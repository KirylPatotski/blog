    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Modern technologies don't improve your life</span></h1>
    <h1>Why do we need them?</h1>

    <p>Some people look with pure excitement into the near and mid future, full of hope and with the certainty that new
        technologies are going to change everything and make the world a better place. There are multiple things that
        are likely to be developed in the near future, revolutionizing their fields and transforming society forever.
        For example, new battery technology, analog computers, new semiconductors, and space technology. The most potent
        changes are going to take place in the space of AI and virtual worlds, getting integrated into our everyday
        lives.</p>

    <p>But let's pause for a minute: why do we need new technologies in the first place? For what?</p>

    <p>A reoccurring theme in my essays is the realization, that there is not a single person <em>genuinely</em>
        thinking that
        the internet had a positive impact on their life. A person who has never truly thought about anything will point
        out the “positive” impact of technology on their time management and other aspects, they will say, the internet
        has made them more productive, made them more creative, or has removed boredom. These things are outright false
        or incomplete. For example, boredom is necessary and healthy, without boredom you are unable to construct any
        sincere thoughts. I'm sure, that every “positive” aspect of the internet can be disproven without a lot of
        conscious effort, but simply by asking the question why and for what. There is unfortunately no way around it. I
        have to use the internet, for example, to update my apps or to publish these blogs. But, using the internet as
        an example, why should that be different from other new technologies, why should they make your life better,
        more valuable, meaningful, or joyful, if recent technologies accomplished the exact opposite? </p>

    <p>Removing modern technologies improves your life quality significantly, so why do we need new ones, the question
        remains unanswered. Someone told me, not too long ago, about the ambition to mine asteroids and extract valuable
        metals from them in order to build new tech. But the obvious question, why we need that, could not be answered,
        since there is nothing missing, that could improve life quality, that could be found in rocks in space. Do you
        think, asteroid mining will make your life more meaningful? Now, someone may point out, that the purpose of
        asteroid mining is to extract metals, and not to provide purpose. In that case, my argument, that new
        technologies are useless, gets confirmed. </p>
