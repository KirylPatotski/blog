    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Focus on your work</span></h1>

    <h1>Full 4 am guide</h1>

    <p>You come home from school or work at 16:00 and feel dull, barely not collapsing from a long day, and then you are
        supposed to work on your business? You rest for a bit and it's already evening. You try to sit down to do
        something and are unable to get any deep work done. Instead, you just waste your time… </p>

    <p>There is a solution, and it's hard. But, you like challenges, otherwise you wouldn't be working on your business
        after everyone else wastes their time on social media. Are you ready?</p>

    <h1>1. Discipline is happiness</h1>

    <p>I enjoyed this year August 2023 the most. I got up at 5 every day, did some work, wrote texts, or read until
        13:00 without eating anything. I had immense levels of discipline and felt happy because of it. I was doing what
        I was supposed to. Imagine the alternative: waking up at 11 a.m. every day, being unproductive, and eating carbs
        right at the start of the day rather than after an 8-hour delay. Where do you think will you be happier? Now
        it's 4:20 and I have been awake for 20 minutes and I'm hungry and cold, but simultaneously I feel mentally very
        sharp and focused It's absolutely quiet, there are no cars to hear, no family members and the sky is black.
        There is only work, some music, and me. I am mentally fully present.</p>

    <h1>2. Whom I write this text for</h1>

    <p>Some people tell me that they work best in the late night rather than the early morning. That's in itself all
        right, but terribly incompatible with the school system. My school, I'm in a gymnasium in Germany in 12th grade
        (I will end school with 16), starts at 7:20. If you are a night owl, it's very unlucky that school starts at
        7:20 because therefore it's obviously impossible to get a routine that ends at 3 in the morning, otherwise, you
        would get only 3 hours of sleep per night. You can't sleep during the day, as the sleep quality is low,
        especially if you are 16, which is basically a child. Therefore, this text is for people who aren't night owls
        and go to school or to work early in the morning.</p>

    <p>Why should you get up at 4 in the first place? It's simple. The focus in the first 2 hours of the morning is
        gifted. If you got up at 6 and school started at 7:20, you would have no time to be productive. After school,
        which lasts on average 7 hours, you get home at 14:00 and are mentally already done. You could take a nap to
        restore parts of your focus to work on your own business for instance, however, the amount and quality of work
        done is incomparable, you get more done between 4:00 and 6:00 than between 14:00 and 20:00 because work doesn't
        depend on your time spent working, but rather on focus. That's why you are suddenly productive when approaching
        a deadline. It feels better to spend your focus in the morning on your own business rather than on school and if
        you are the best student doing so, that's even better. Working when you are already mentally numbed by input,
        food and the day's time (after lunch) is not the way it's supposed to be. </p>

    <h1>3. Why at 4 and not at 5</h1>

    <p>Working early gives the benefits of immense focus. This is great because it makes you do the important and
        difficult work first, which means you are doing what you are supposed to and are happy; additionally, presence
        creates happiness too. It feels as if you are on a different level when getting up at 4 and sitting at your desk
        at 4:06, already working. Getting up at 5 feels almost the same but with a 1-hour difference. This one-hour
        difference is significant. It takes 15 minutes to reach a flow and the flow lasts, at max, 1.5 hours. That
        means, if you get up at 4, your potential flow goes until 5:45, on the other hand, your flow would have ended
        early if you got up at 5. A flow is a state of the mind, where you forget everything else around you and start
        to morph into your task, making it feel effortless. For example, yesterday, on Sunday the 15.10.2023, I had some
        paper to write for school. I got up at 5 and wrote it until the sun rose, at 7, and didn't notice 2 hours
        passing.</p>

    <p>The simple feeling of getting up at 4 is different than getting up at 5. While getting up at 5 sounds like you
        are listening to some motivational videos, getting up at 4 shows that you are serious. But, in both cases, the
        sun rises, as you start to finish your work. The discipline created in the process is next-level, especially, if
        you do the hard work first. “Crazy man getting up at 4 every day voluntarily”</p>

    <p>It's also more natural to go to bed at 8 and to get up at 4 than it is to go to bed at 10 and wake up at 6
        because your cycle should be closer to the cyclic movements of the sun. Another benefit of such a sleep schedule
        is that you can sleep for much longer if suddenly needed because you have an additional 2 hours.</p>

    <p>I should stress the importance of not eating in the morning, commonly referred to as intermittent fasting. If you
        want presence and mental clarity, you have to be hungry. It sounds ironic, but if you feel hungry, you are still
        able to focus without problems. However, while saturated, your body uses a lot of capacity to digest the food,
        which creates brain fog. Other animals don't eat breakfast either, and some only once a day. You should do that
        if you are an adult. But, after you have done your work, in the morning, you should still eat. </p>

    <h1>4. Start with getting up at 5</h1>

    <p>A long time ago, I don't know exactly when I set myself the deadline, for Sunday, the first of May to get up at
        5, but it was already a long time ago. At that time, I even went for runs, but later replaced that with walks
        and in June with work. The walks at 5 in May added a lot of life quality, but were a waste of time; now I only
        go for walks from 17 to 19 (now since it's dark from 16 to 18), otherwise, I would be sacrificing focus. </p>

    <p>I woke up at 5 on May 1 2023 and had an amazing day, just as the subsequent. I couldn't adjust my sleep schedule;
        it took an entire week. I got up anyway, and therefore my progress was fast. Please don't think you will be able
        to change gradually. Chances are, your discipline isn't that sophisticated, at least mine isn't, and the
        temptations of ignoring the alarm are just too great. If your discipline was large enough to never press snooze,
        you should skip this process altogether and get up at 5 anyway. This process builds discipline! </p>

    <p>After this week, when I started to go to bed at 21 and wake up at 5, I started doing it without an alarm, I did
        have my alarm as a backup. I made a huge mistake while doing so, which I only fixed yesterday. I used my phone
        as an alarm clock. That's problematic because “snoozing” creates huge temptations and your phone distracts you
        right from the morning and robs productivity. I used my alarm clock instead, and it made everything
        significantly easier. I started to implement another powerful tip. Every evening I laid the full outfit next to
        my bed so that I could wake up, feel initially tired, and still get clothed so that I could work on my desk
        right away, it's important to leave the bed physically. Working in your bed isn't natural. Your bed is for
        resting. Also, in the evening, I put everything in the place. My computer, a glass bottle, and if it works for
        you: don't turn off your computer, so you can continue with work right away. Not turning off your computer is a
        double-edged sword. It gets easier to start with work again but creates psychological pressure that something
        isn't done, which may cause useless subconscious unrest, therefore I don't do it anymore. What you should
        absolutely turn off is your phone. Parts of the focus are created, because no one will bother you.</p>

    <h1>5. After a few months, get up at 4</h1>

    <p>As I have been getting up at 5 more or less consistently, I got undisciplined in October of 2023 and slipped
        back. Because I was weakened by recent events, I got up at 8 instead of 5, and my life got much worse. It made
        me realize how great it was in the first place. But I used this pain of being undisciplined to change. I woke up
        1 hour earlier every day and kept the momentum to improve my sleeping schedule further, to 4. I would therefore
        go to bed at 20:00, which is great since I don't accomplish anything at that time either. Here I decreased
        gradually, by 1 hour per day. That means, today is the first day of my life, where I get up at 4. I only
        realized to put my clothes next to my bed and to use an alarm clock instead a few days ago, I didn't know it.
        The morning sets the rest of the day, so let it be productive. </p>

    <p>To give you an extra tip for the beginning, think about getting up at 4 or 5, depending on where you are right
        now, multiple times throughout the day, and track what time you get up every day in a notebook.</p>

    <h1>6. Cut</h1>

    <p>What if there is some activity, such as a sports club, that ends at 22:00 for instance, it will make you unable
        to go to bed at 20:00 or 21:00 and then get up at 4:00 or 5:00. I will say right here, drop it. You won't regret
        it in the long run. Often more is less, and sometimes you need to remove weight to fly further. </p>

    <h1>7. More tips</h1>

    <p>When should you stop improving your sleeping schedule? You don't want to get up at midnight, otherwise, you have
        become a night owl. I think your schedule is good enough if it starts at 3:45. 2.5 hours of focus is enough for
        anything and going to bed at 19:00 is natural. Otherwise, you can keep improving this skill of getting up early
        by adding sports for example, or by reducing comfort to build more discipline.</p>

    <p>Let's say you aren't a student and you don't sleep alone. Should you try to improve your partner's sleeping
        schedule? I have learned from talking to strangers, during my walks, that it's not as much of a problem as it
        seems, as leaving the room isn't too loud, that applies if one person is a sparrow and the other one a night
        owl. What if you are both a "morning person", should your wife get the same discipline as you? No, the will to
        improve must come from within to be sustainable. </p>

    <p>(Paragraph added a few days later) Because your day's productive sessions are limited, your work becomes more
        focused on the important and urgent tasks, because there is not much time left for those “cute” redundant tasks.
        Now my daily routine changed and I have 3 productive hours, 4,5, and 18. My productivity didn't decrease,
        rather, it got more focused and intense. </p>

    <p>Remember, what you are doing it for in the first place. If you feel like going to bed again, think twice and
        think of the pain you are saving yourself from. Remember to fight at first, and to use slip-backs to improve
        further. Don't allow excuses. </p>

    <p>I woke up at 4 for the first time today. </p>
