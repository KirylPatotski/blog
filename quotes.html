        authentic living.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_99.html">#</a> The feminine wants to receive, the masculine wants to give; mixing roles causes

        have a habit in common whether
        it be school, work, or parties, most of the time it's a bad habit.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_98.html">#</a> Most people live absolutely pathetic lives. Most people challenge themselves to live
        an invisible inauthentic meaningless life in quite desperation.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_98.html">#</a> There are 3 kinds of love, Eros, romantic love, Philia, the love towards friends and
        family, and there is Agape, unconditional love towards God. Don't mix them up, otherwise, your life will be
        incomplete.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_98.html">#</a> My children, I love you, yet we aren't friends either. Similarly, parents can't be
        friends with their children, otherwise, they will develop in a messed-up way.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_98.html">#</a> See, what they took from you. Perhaps most of your problems are caused by too much
        societal damage created by the internet, social media, and a meta-capitalist society.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_98.html">#</a> It's your responsibility to fix that. You are in control.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_98.html">#</a> How do you know if someone is trustworthy? Well, they are authentic. They don't try
        to change you, and they have their lives in perfect order.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_98.html">#</a> How do you find better friends? It's by being a better friend yourself. Call that
        person and ask how he is doing. Be trustworthy, authentic, and humble, don't try to change others, and have your
        life in perfect order. Don't be complicated or arrogant. There are great people everywhere once you leave
        your room, if you build yourself up. In friendship, similar people attract each other, hence be a good friend to
        have good friends.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_97.html">#</a> Get to know your dark side, otherwise, it will dictate your life.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_97.html">#</a> Common sense and good sense are necessary to determine if something is moral or
        not. Before using arguments from authority or justification, remember that some unspeakable acts may be
        justified with rational -ism. - Yet your heart is going to know the truth. </p>

    <p><a href="blog_97.html">#</a> Consciousness gives the ability to distinguish between right and wrong.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_97.html">#</a> Everything comes at a price.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_97.html">#</a> Let me reveal a perfectly moral trait - discipline.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_97.html">#</a> You are already in ownership of precise knowledge of the people who forgot the core
        of morality.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_97.html">#</a> Won't people try to kill paradise simply to prove their point?</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Discipline is nice, yet the “why” is of vital importance. The “why” sets free
        monumental energy.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Learn from text, not from regret.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> This is a story, and it's called life. </p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Every day, you must face the choice of embracing life or giving up.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> No one cares about the weak.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Complacency and comfort are the killer of meaning, thus inducing a life filled
        with void.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Freedom only makes sense in the presence of constraints.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> If you lose, you are a loser.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Achievement isn't relative.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Praise is powerful to motivate the feminine, not the masculine as it means the goal
        is already accomplished.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Egoistic sources of motivation run dry eventually; egoistic motivation isn't enough.
    </p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Escape complacency by having goals and a purpose in life.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Motivate yourself by saying: 'I do it to sleep well tonight, I want to know that
        I've done everything there was to do and went to my limit.'</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Exhaustion is nice, both mental and physical; it shows you have given your best.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Add pressure by pinning your goals to your wall; work excellently under pressure.
    </p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Discipline removes almost any negative character traits.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Fix insecurity by proving everyone wrong.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Every negative emotion was designed to give motivation and strength.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Positive emotions are the reward for doing things right.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Analyze where your current sources of pleasure are; control what gets your energy.
    </p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Regret is a bitter form of pain that leads to motivation; it's a powerful source.
    </p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Identity shift is necessary for energy transmutation; take radical responsibility.
    </p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Focus on the outward.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Choose the right woman; she is the single most important decision in your life.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> A teacher whose students surpass him becomes immortal.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_96.html">#</a> Always keep in mind your limited time</p>

    <p>Your life consists of decades, decades of years, years of months, months of weeks, weeks of days, days of
        mornings,
        and mornings of nights. Hence, the right evening is of vital importance.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> There's never a situation in life where you are better off with digital addiction.
    </p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> Ask yourself the question once a week for the rest of your life; What's the biggest
        thing holding me back, that I could fix? If you ask this question with humility, you shall improve. Hence, it is
        the wise student, who has the humility to find space for improvement and improves to
        eventually surpass his ancient. </p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> This will change the trajectory of your life forever. Imagine having a few hours per
        day extra for the rest of your life.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> A story, one of pain, made worse by addiction. </p>


    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> Most people are illiterate and almost mentally disabled. Unable to sit down to read
        2 pages</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> What most people are lacking is the ability to focus. If you ask anyone what they
        are lacking in life to become successful they may list some nonsense like time, money, connections, ideas, or
        knowledge.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> A short attention span will make every aspect of your life worse: relationships,
        work, health, and consumption behavior. It's the opposite of long-term thinking.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> Desexualization is the first step to success. </p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> Self-control is a key component of success and yet social media removes this trait
        and tries to discourage it.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> Validation is misleading.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> You can forgive young people's stupidity, but if you are stupid and no longer young,
        you have lost. </p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> Comparison is always harmful, competition drives performance.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> No man is less free than the one convinced of his own freedom.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> You will never get into a scenario where you are forced to lie.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> Overstimulation blinds, both literally and figuratively.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> When I sit somewhere to wait, I'm often the only one present and taking deep
        breaths, everyone else is sunk in their phone. Who do you think is happier? </p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> Bad habits are combined.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> It took 500 hours to learn how to program, driving school (will take) 70 hours, and
        200 hours to write a 100,000-word blog. Yet, over the span of 5 years I've wasted 7600 hours on digital
        addiction. There are 8760 hours in a year.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> Change your identity to align your life and subconcious.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> You aren't trying to quit, you simply never do it. </p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> I will go as far as to break up on the spot, digital addiction is a too-great red
        flag. </p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> Moderation is the change of extremes.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> Your brain may argue against you at this instance.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_95.html">#</a> It is the student who learns by constant repetition in practice who makes progress.
        The student who pnly listens
        sacrifices progress, the student trying in practice will show greater humility and advance further as a
        result. Constant sacrifice is necessary to reduce weight.</p>

        to prepare, make this the time

        you pretend as if you never read these sentences and move on, or you change. The choice is yours.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_93.html">#</a> If there is moral good nor moral harm, why are you doing it? Is dying your hair or

        No, it's indifferent, so why are you wasting your time?</p>

    <p><a href="blog_93.html">#</a> Imperatives and maxims served me well</p>

    <p><a href="blog_93.html">#</a> I don't need to hear any nonsense stemming from your insecurities,<em> just because
            you
            think you can't do it
            doesn't mean I haven't done it. </em>At no time did listening to self-limiting beliefs serve me.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_92.html">#</a> Ask yourself, what's the biggest thing holding me back right now?</p>

    <p><a href="blog_92.html">#</a> Discipline forever</p>

    <p><a href="blog_92.html">#</a> Fear of too sudden progress. “You have asked out that girl, why don't you make the
        second move” is the all-encompassing phrase.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_92.html">#</a> Working in bed. Discipline is doing the right things, especially when you don't feel
        like it.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_92.html">#</a>How am I going to become consistent if I don't have a routine for
        it?</p>

    <p><a href="blog_92.html">#</a>Not digging for gold. I know that I should be reading a lot more, yet reading on a
        computer never brings me into a flow. I should be reading 1 book per week, and I hold the self-limiting belief
        that spending 1000€ on books is too expensive.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_92.html">#</a> If I'm unable to stay disciplined at home in my room, where will I be?</p>

    <p><a href="blog_92.html">#</a> Slipbacks are part of progress. I lived right for 6 months, then I slipped
        back partially, and now I'm ready for an even longer period of more discipline.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_92.html">#</a> The temptations will increase, and I'm fighting with music sacrifice.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_92.html">#</a> What's the essence of self-improvement? It's to find weak points and turn them into

        unsuccessfully, but then, after coming back the solution became visibly screaming? You aren't in a rush. You
        don't need to come back after 10 minutes of rest, you can also come back
        after 5 years, with a fundamentally transformed perspective. </p>

        of ideas running dry. However, after a while, creativity always returns…</p>

    <p><a href="blog_91.html">#</a> Be grateful for that creative peak, most people never had one. Enjoy the peak, you

    <p>At the beginning of both September and October I wrote things like “Waiting for interesting things to happen”
        Both times, enough interesting things happened faster than expected.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_90.html">#</a> Purpose is a vision that occupies your mind both consciously and subconsciously. It
        gives your life meaning and is something you work and live for.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_90.html">#</a> I continuously remind you, to think in 10-year intervals into the future and to
        delay gratification, sacrifice, and genuinely try your best at everything you do… But how about you get rid of
        gratification altogether for a while?</p>

    <p><a href="blog_90.html">#</a> I will rest with extreme discipline and not with instant gratification.</p>

        improving further.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_90.html">#</a> Spirituality and minimalism aren't about owning less and only owning things that add
        value to your life. It's about getting everything taken away from you and still being happy!</p>

    <p><a href="blog_87.html">#</a> I feel broken. I know, that thinking highly of myself and staying disciplined helps.
        I deserve more than the rest and now I got humbled again.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_87.html">#</a> When I was younger, maybe 8, I sprinted everywhere I went, jumped downstairs, and
        walked multiple steps at a time. I don't know if that's a fake memory, but I think I asked the after-school care
        why adults are slowing down. I don't remember the response and it doesn't matter. As I'm 16 right now, I see how
        everyone slowed down, while I sped up.</p>

        moment of bliss, after a few hours it fades and you are ready for the next thing.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_87.html">#</a> Happiness is an emotion, and it comes and goes like leaves in the wind. Fulfillment

        again?</p>

    <p><a href="blog_85.html">#</a> It's time to be disciplined again.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_85.html">#</a> A lack of discipline doesn't show the true self.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_83.html">#</a> Always, it's some 'insignificant' detail that's making the difference.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_83.html">#</a> Decide emotionally, justify logically.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_82.html">#</a> Every moment is a test. Whether it's an imaginary flash holding you back from going
        for walks or a mindless moment wasted on the internet, no moment should be wasted, everything happening is a
        test that you must pass.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_82.html">#</a> Yes, life is unfair.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_82.html">#</a> If every moment constitutes a test, doesn't that mean that trying your best is the
        only solution to life's unfairness?</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Learn from the mistakes of others, skip that nonsense.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Do you want your life to consist of non-unique lessons?</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> It's about you, you will adapt, fight, and hate changes.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Eventually, you will have to settle in one place, so why not choose your home place
        as the place to settle?</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> I lived in 2 cities, which could not have been more different, in all metrics. What
        did it teach me? It's the same everywhere. It depends on yourself.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Don't repeat mistakes others have done and regret.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> It's easy not to learn from others and have to learn it on your own because it makes
        you look stupid, but looking stupid, most of the time only to yourself, is temporary, while regret stays, it's
        long term.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Rewarding yourself shouldn't happen with things that harm you.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> It's better to spend your last days with your children than with your cat and photos
        of how you went for dinner alone your whole life.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Expressing yourself is necessary because otherwise a stronger person will express
        themselves and get what they wanted.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Authenticity also means thinking for yourself and not listening to ideology and
        beliefs as well as opinions not coming from yourself.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Be authentic in what you want and say.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> No event is ever going to lead to increased happiness, but rather an improved life
        and
        mind
        will lead to well-being.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> I've made mistakes too. If you talk with others about them, you may see people with
        much worse mistakes.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Regret doesn't disappear when you resolve, accept and move on. It stays a permanent
        memorial in your mind to remind you of the catastrophe.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Later doesn't exist, you only exist in the current moment.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Regret is the key to forgiving, by moral and legal law. Let those regrets be
        warnings, and view and accept them as such.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> Do what you are supposed to. Act categorically and stay morally correct with your
        acting as well.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_80.html">#</a> The biggest risk is not taking risks at all.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_79.html">#</a> Failures kill and create fear as a result.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_79.html">#</a> I won't run out of content to write about.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_79.html">#</a> The best times were the ones where I worked the hardest.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_79.html">#</a> I will write down things I learned or done in my progress tracker right away. This
        will incentivize me to do the small and important things.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_79.html">#</a> Deadlines accelerate.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_79.html">#</a> Little tasks will lay a solid foundation.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_79.html">#</a> I will not collapse my tripod and put my camera on the shelf on the day I'm supposed
        to record something. Neither will I turn off my computer, I should have no excuse to start my day at 5 with
        productivity. </p>

    <p><a href="blog_77.html">#</a> Your thoughts may be against you at this very moment.</p>

    <h2>September 2023</h2>

    <p><a href="blog_74.html">#</a> The concept of free time has been corrupted as well, there shouldn't be free time in
        the traditional sense. There is either intense work or intense rest, no passive state of consumption or bad
        habits. 'Work hard, play hard'</p>

    <p><a href="blog_74.html">#</a> Boredom accelerates</p>

    <p><a href="blog_74.html">#</a> Please don't mistake self-harm for rewarding yourself.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_74.html">#</a> Rewarding yourself and resting must be something sustainable, positive, and perhaps
        even boring. Work has to be interesting instead.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_74.html">#</a> 10 days of burnout was the price of 2 years of uninterrupted performance. That's a
        good trade in my opinion.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_74.html">#</a> My relation to resting and rewarding myself has always been a difficult one. Maybe
        our personalities simply aren't compatible.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_73.html">#</a> Anyone can become competent, a master.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_73.html">#</a> Once you become competent in one area, you have already laid the foundation for
        everything else.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_73.html">#</a> With competence, you can gain freedom, respect, forgiveness, material success, and
        status. Everything the material world has to offer.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_73.html">#</a> If you excel at something difficult, it becomes fun!</p>

    <p><a href="blog_73.html">#</a> The key to worldly success is Competence.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_72.html">#</a> Follow your heart or your mind. Don't be in the middle.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_72.html">#</a> If opposites attract each other, so do strong magnets have higher forces than
        neutral pieces of iron.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_72.html">#</a> "Do it anyway" stands categorically for itself. It is order. I don't let motivation
        and desire dictate my day.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_72.html">#</a> Math itself is ordered, as 1 is always 1, 'is' means 'is,' not 'is' means 'seems.

        itself.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_72.html">#</a> Everything you thought to know about the order, the masculine, and the chaos of the
        feminine is, to a large extent, nonsense, low resolution, and sometimes means the exact opposite.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_72.html">#</a> "Thoughts are projections, created by your body and mind, not your soul. You could
        'see' the exact same thing and yet make no meaning of it because your soul needs to see something as it is
        rather than a projection created by your body and mind.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_72.html">#</a> You and I aren't the thinkers; we are just our souls communicating with our bodies
        with the help of thoughts. The direct communication of your soul and the world is called enlightenment.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_71.html">#</a> Spirituality unlocks new parts of the mind, and therefore a new part of reality
        itself, as reality, is mainly a representation of the world. That's why you need spirituality in the first place
        and that's why it's useful in any case - it makes your soul
        free.</p>
