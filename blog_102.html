    <h1>On a day of mine.</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Decision one.</em></strong> Today I received a digital letter from Google, warning me that I need to
        complete some legal stuff regarding my apps. The email explained that by December 7th, I am required to update
        the apps' privacy policies and data collection forms. It said that I needed to update my apps to allow account
        deletion. However, there is a slight problem with that. My apps don't have accounts that can be created in the
        first place. So, I tried to update the privacy policy and wasted a lot of time while doing so, after all, how do
        you write a privacy policy if you collect no data? I know that Google collects data, yet I don't get to see it,
        only a very shallow selection of it in the case of a crash. I spent hours trying to figure out this issue and I
        don't know if it was a success. I'm not a lawyer, I'm a philosopher. I could learn about this legal stuff, but
        that would be useless because even a little mistake could be fatal and a lawyer is necessary. The developer
        panel also said that I needed to verify my account by adding a passport. Firstly, I'm not 18, so I would have to
        use my mother's passport. What I don't understand is that I already had to verify the account while creating it.
        So, that means I have to take action on my apps regularly, regardless if I want to and those actions tend to be
        annoying. </p>

    <p>I thought further and I concluded that my apps are holding me back. </p>

    <p><em>“I feel as if I should cut the rope and delete the first app from the internet and wipe anything related to
            it. This would give my words new meaning and cut out any alternatives - that's what a decision means. But
            this would be irrational because the apps remain a great asset and maybe the right time may come for them. I
            should move on and make peace with my apps, but it's not reasonable to cut them because they have no
            downsides, most of the memories associated with them remain positive. On the other hand, if I deleted them,
            I would lose one year's worth of assets and gain a new perspective, one where I could not lay back on
            existing things and would need to step forward with both feet instead to replace the rope with a metal
            necklace. But this time, the metal necklace simply gets added. Beautiful.”</em> - blog 64</p>

    <p>What kind of asset are apps that annoy me, already failed with commercial success, and could bring me in trouble?
        I have no clue about legal stuff. Don't I have to focus solely on YouTube to progress, doesn't focus imply that
        attention shouldn't be split? If I delete my apps from the internet, it will remove temptations to work on them
        further and allow for greater focus. The apps served me well to build my skills, but beyond that they are
        useless, so why should I keep them? Having apps in the Google Play store will get me better jobs, but I can
        simply upload them to a website specifically made to store code. I originally intended the apps to serve me
        while building up skills, and I enjoyed doing so, building them was a very valuable addition to my life. I
        aligned my life with them and built a wide array of skills with them, yet now that's over. Yet, after spending a
        lot of time on them, I got deluded into thinking that I could turn them into successes, and that never happened,
        happens, or will happen. Apps are just an interface for a business and its users and never the business itself.
        I can't build such a business alone and with no experience, so why should I keep my apps? The apps served me
        well and now they no longer do. So, I shall subtract them?</p>

    <p>Talking about subtracting, I tell you to remember the external and the long-term. I will ask my grandmother what
        she thinks of it and she will tell me that I'm correct and that I should delete every app of mine from the
        internet as well as the developer account and start fresh when it's necessary when the right time comes. Am I
        right?</p>

    <p>I have to assess this question properly. What's the worst-case scenario of keeping these apps? It's getting into
        legal trouble; it's bringing my parents into legal trouble. Is that an acceptable risk, considering that my apps
        don't bring any extra value anymore? What's the best positive scenario? These apps grow by themselves, yet this
        best-case scenario is already ruled out by reality. Perhaps the concept of “apps” is something outdated already
        and I should move on from that sphere entirely. </p>

    <p>This decision-making tactic applies to everything. Is an illegal car race something you should consider? What if
        you kill someone in the process? The best-case scenario is validation for 5 minutes from unintelligent people.
        Well, what's the best- and worst-case scenario and how likely are they? If something has infinite potential
        downsides, don't do it. Only consider things with finite potential losses and infinite potential gains, for
        example, going to a competition is something with finite potential losses and potential infinite potential when
        played honestly. </p>

    <p>I must also add, that rational decisions don't exist, they are made emotionally and then justified logically. I
        developed resentment for my apps and hence tried to argue against them. At first, I was emotionally tied to my
        apps, that's why I kept working on them, I was scared of the apps failing. Now, I lost faith and built
        resentment, and now I'm justifying it as well. The truly objective perspective doesn't exist.</p>

    <p>My grandmother replied.<em>“You're absolutely right. But my mom and I were also right that you don't know all the
            legal aspects and subtleties. Life and its mysteries are learned in the process of life and society, not by
            shutting yourself off from the outside world. You keep saying you don't need to know it. But ignorance does
            not exempt anyone from responsibility. I don't know the laws of the Internet. I'll let my mom read it. But I
            already have an idea. How to preserve your work and get it out there.”</em> </p>


    <p>...</p>

    <p>So, I got to the deletion of my account, and the deletion process is made hard. Every app must be deleted
        individually. Every separation was painful, especially there where I saw potential. Two of mine haven't been
        tested on the free market now; an app with math, memory, and sports for elders as well as GymMath, a mental math
        app designed for the gym. There were moments when I felt my heart beating fast because I made the separation. I
        fancied about everything that could have been, doubted my decision, and was hesitant… </p>

    <p>Yet now, every app is offline, and the account was submitted for deletion. Now that I deleted these apps, I put a
        lot of effort in, I feel some release, I feel freer. It felt scary for a mere 30 seconds, yet changed the
        trajectory of my life forever.</p>


    <p><em>Added December 2nd. </em> As of now, it seems to be impossible to move on (to get the accounts deleted)
        because of some stuff with the terms and conditions, and I've tried to use my rights as EU GDPR article 17 §1
        (“The right of erasure”) and article 21 (“The right to withdraw consent”), yet I'm stuck with uncertainty
        because December 2nd is a weekend. And this uncertainty annoys me. Read further here. <a
            href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">https://gdpr-info.eu/</a></p>

    <p>I've told you already that my favorite text is text #50, “Failures Kill” and I want to rephrase it here again.
        <em>“This text sounds like a love story, and that is because they are the same thing, called life.”</em>
    </p>


    <p><strong><em>Decision two.</em></strong> I can't only subtract things from my life, adding things to it is also
        necessary to add things. I always preach things like “Admit being stupid and move on as a smarter person, stay
        humble or be humbled.” For 11 years, I've been a vegetarian. From the age of 5, I fought against eating meat and
        as I became 11 years old, my family gave up and now for 5 years, until the age of 16, I didn't eat meat, except
        for fish. Now I've stopped being a vegetarian and ate meat again, chicken. Surprisingly, when I ate meat again,
        I remembered why I became a vegetarian in the first place because I find that meat tastes disgusting. I at least
        gave it a try because I was free from my old beliefs. The average person would have fought against it, because
        you have to protect your ego, right? Yet, protecting your ego brings no one anywhere. I won't stop eating meat
        again, because I will discipline myself to simply eat it, although that will have its limits. For example, never
        will I consider eating sausages, those are simply unhealthy, and subtracting those kinds of highly processed
        foods won't be regretted. I think I'm a highly dangerous person, with infinite energy already and I don't know
        what's going to happen once I start to eat meat again, habitually.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Decision three.</em></strong> Another thing I will need to add is a stricter evening routine.
        <em>Your life consists of decades, decades of years, years of months, months of weeks, weeks of days, days of
            morning, and mornings of nights. Hence, the right evening is of vital importance.</em> My evening routine is
        already decently sophisticated, with an evening prayer, yet I will need to discipline myself to write in my
        diary consistently again to clear my mind and to reflect, additionally, I will discipline myself to read before
        bed. Also, I will plan what I will do in the morning because indecision creates many problems, it slows down
        progress.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Indecision four.</em></strong> I still can't decide what I'm going to do about her, I don't know if I
        should add or subtract.</p>


    <p><strong><em>Statement one, December 1st.</em></strong> The monk mode started not without problems, as I wasted my
        morning in unproductive pain, as written in yesterday's text. I also wasted time on the first decision, the one
        with the apps. This means, the day only started at noon and ended at 20:00. Additionally, it means, that not
        having an evening routine is holding me back and I should add a stricter one. I also spent/wasted a bunch of
        time editing the November photos - all because I didn't prepare enough mentally on the 30th of November. Later,
        I did end up recording a 20-minute video, the text “The power of the will is stronger.” (#88, 20 minutes) And
        wrote large parts of this text. Additionally, I read an entire book on lies and manipulation.I also spent an
        hour cleaning my room, after getting up. Overall, an
        unproductive day by my standards. It may sound like much, but most of the day was wasted.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Statement two, December 2nd.</em></strong> Everything I imagined regarding the monk mode turned out
        to be well thought through. I must admit, that I haven't started with reading poetry, and neither did I start
        with an evening routine. Despite the last video being 3 weeks ago, today's and yesterday's videos were
        effortless. I thought about this monk mode long enough, 3 weeks to be precise and I have trained my mind to
        excel at speaking English with ease - and the mind did its work. As of the morning of December 2nd, I recorded 2
        additional videos: “Stop Watching News” (#17) 3 minutes, together with “Long Life” (#61), 10 minutes. I started
        to edit them and while the video editing program ran, I was busy writing. Today, December 2nd, I got up at 5:30,
        because I was a bit sleep-deprived. It's currently 8:03 and I've recorded 2 videos and written a few hundred
        words. I love having something to do, when I am exhausted from writing, I can simply edit or record videos.</p>

    <p>Later on December 2nd I edited and published these 3 videos and spent the time between 15:00 and 17:00 doing
        nothing, as intended. I also wrote 3000 words on a new text.</p>

    <p>I love my new lifestyle; the edge is the only place to find happiness.</p>
