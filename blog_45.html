    <p>In 2018, I visited Belarus for what now marks my last trip there (as of 2023). During that visit, I captured just
        four photos, each of which holds immense significance. Upon closer examination, you'll observe that these images
        possess a unique qualityâ€”they're not fully pixelated, but rather carry an almost pixelated essence.<br><br>
        I made a deliberate choice to edit these photos in such a manner. This approach serves as a means to preserve my
        memories in a distinctive manner. Given that 2018 now stands five years behind, the transformations I've
        undergone during this period have been profound. Consequently, only the fundamental structures of my former self
        have endured, much like the coarse outlines in the photos. Yet, despite these changes, certain aspects have
        remained unaltered. These subtle consistencies are embedded beneath the pixelated facade, waiting to be
        discovered.<br><br>
        Symbolically, the pixelation mirrors how memories often fade and lose their sharpness over prolonged periods. As
        time passes, some recollections become fragile and delicate, just as the details in these images are obscured.
        Nonetheless, I hold onto the hope of returning to Belarus in the near future, eager to reconnect with the
        essence of those cherished memories.<br>
