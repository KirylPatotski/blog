    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Perfect imperfections and meaning</span></h1>

    <h1>Life is paradise, actually</h1>

    <p>The ideas in this text have been conceptualized already a long time ago, and first written down in April 2023. I
        wanted to create this text already earlier, but I create it now because my writing skills as well as thinking
        skills got sophisticated enough and I don't want this writing to be manipulated by my “perfect” life or by any
        external event. </p>

    <p>Construct yourself the classical version of paradise. You may be tempted to think, that you want absolute
        abundance of everything. You want all your desires to be fulfilled, with food, sex, luxury, safety, good
        weather, and so on. But, as you have read my previous text, “Dreams” you know, that these desires are
        short-lived, and will get boring soon. But, how do you avoid this world to get boring? There are a few options.
        If I have covered every option, you'll be able to understand, that life is already paradise, because the
        alternatives would be a lot worse.</p>

    <p>The first option could be implemented today. Let's imagine yourself being on a spaceship to Mars, almost alone.
        The way to keep yourself entertained would be with technology. Obviously, if you are in a modern spaceship, the
        pinnacle of human achievement. You would take a bunch of music, video games, literature, art, and videos with
        you. In 9 months, you could read a very decent number of books, considering you have nothing else to do. You
        could read for up to 12 hours a day, meaning, you could easily read 250 books. If reading isn't your thing, you
        can play video games, although that's a waste of time, and I doubt that the astronauts flying to Mars will do it
        extensively. Those things are still in the real world, therefore they won't run out of fun, because the
        situation you are in, is itself interesting, meaningful, and adventurous. </p>

    <p>So, let's take it a step further. You are located in a nuclear bunker. You also have an abundance of media to
        consume. Remember, will live in this bunker forever. Now, you get an option. Since the real world went downhill,
        you are considering turning on an AR machine, that will project the perfect world onto you. This new world will
        be perfect in every way, you will never feel bored, anxious, or anything. Do you take this offer or not? No.
        Why? Because the reality is better than a fake one. This concept is called the pleasure cube, a thought
        experiment. In this thought experiment you have the option to remain in the real world or to transition into a
        cube, where you can't leave anymore and this cube will provide you with happiness indefinitely. Still, people
        don't want that, unless they are totally desperate. </p>

    <p>There are multiple utopian books, that seem to create paradise. No one reads them, rather people prefer to read
        dystopian books. Why do you think is that the case? Because people don't want paradise. With our current
        technology, we could create a life of abundance for everyone. That's now what people want because people tend to
        fabricate problems. So, there would be people trying to overthrow the system all the time in order for them to
        gain power and add something interesting to their lives. </p>

    <p>Ok, we have learned, that we need to keep the world real and interesting. So, your paradise may not only include
        an abundance of anything desirable but also include an infinite world to explore, because exploring digital
        worlds is not as interesting, because it's fake. To make it even more interesting, let's spread those desirable
        things randomly across the world. Let's make you immoral just like in a video game. Did you see, what I did
        here? Instead of playing video games, you are basically in a video game now, with the only difference being that
        this is now a reality for you. But video games get rather boring fast, if you play video games for 1 hour you
        may already experience extreme boredom. That's why this version of paradise can't be it. </p>

    <p>Now, before we continue with the next constructed paradise, we need to answer an important question. Would you be
        able to move? The answer is surprisingly interesting. Discipline is needed to get out of bed. Discipline is
        developed by hardship. If hardship is missing in paradise, you won't get out of bed that easily. If you can't
        get out of bed, you suffer internally, as a direct consequence, because your brain doesn't want you to be a
        loser. If paradise is the peak of pleasure, with any desire fulfilled, how will you be able to move at all? Some
        people find it hard to get out of bed in real life, even though real life is far away from paradise. Why should
        you move at all through paradise, if you already have everything? </p>

    <p>Ok, so the next try of paradise - the real world, but with one twist. Every extreme suffering, like child
        soldiers, cancer, absolute poverty, violence, war, pollution… will be removed. Doesn't that sound exciting? It's
        not. I acknowledge, such a world is not too far away from ours, but our world has, although it had improved
        significantly, still has a lot of problems. Our world is moving towards paradise. For example, the number of
        deaths through smallpox has fallen from hundreds of thousands to 0 per year since 1980. To 0. Smallpox used to
        be the deadliest disease of all. Why would such a world not be desirable? I will explain that with the example
        of math 100 years ago.</p>

    <p>In math of the early 20th century, there were 3 fundamental questions. Is math complete, consistent, and
        decidable? Complete would mean, everything that math has to offer will eventually be discovered and proven.
        Consistent would mean, only true things could be proven, meaning only true things are relevant. The final
        question is whether math is decidable, that means, if there is a way to predict everything. Surprisingly, the
        answers were: math is incomplete, it can't prove that it's always correct, and is certainly not predictable.
        Essentially, this means, math has some dark spots and will always have them. Now, let's assume, what I just said
        was the opposite (except that math can prove wrong things (=consistency)) That would mean, everything non-random
        can be predicted and everything will be discovered and proven soon. Let's ignore that this is impossible because
        it leads to contradictions. If everything will eventually be discovered, we should be able to create a math book
        containing everything. If we create a math book with everything, all the other sciences would follow. Now you
        have discovered everything there ever was or will be. This would mean, that every technology, that is possible
        in our universe would have already been invented at that point. We could fix every problem on earth and create a
        world with no flaws. But this world would be uninteresting because there would be nothing left to discover. That
        means flaws need to exist to make progress and progress, or at least change must exist in order to create an
        interesting life. </p>

    <p>Ok, let's create a world, which is like ours, but with less extreme suffering. This world will still be
        interesting. Let's also add a bit of abundance, that's better than scarcity. The first statement is correct,
        that's what we are aiming for. Now, why is there this foolish assumption that abundance is better than scarcity?
        Let's list all the abundant resources, there are not that many: stones, salt water, and air. All of these
        resources can be considered worthless because they are abundant. People don't value free things, because free
        things are being taken for granted, and therefore are not connected to any pain in the process of acquiring
        these resources. If everything becomes free, it becomes worthless and meaningless, therefore you will have much
        less meaning in your life, which makes the life itself worthless. Scarcity is value. A piece of gold is more
        valuable than a stone you find on the side of the road, simply because the piece of gold is harder to obtain.
    </p>

    <p>Now, let's create a world, which is like ours. Life will be with less extreme suffering, and still interesting.
        There will be no excess abundance. But the government will take care of the people, partially, (not stripping
        them away from freedom too much) and computers will recommend important life decisions, using the data they
        collected from these individuals. Data is worthless, even though we live in the information era. Big companies
        like Google try to solve this, by simply collecting everything, because if you collect everything, you will
        surely find something of value, or maybe if you don't find anything, AI can be trained to do so. Now, let's
        start a thought experiment, where a computer program will be able to identify the perfect partner for you. You
        may think, that the perfect one would be boring, true, but the perfect one for you may still be far away from
        actual perfection. Since there is so much data about both of you, a fairly simple computer program would be able
        to identify, where your life is headed and even recommend to you when to find the right one. This computer
        program will also consider, that your personalities don't have to match, they should complete one another and
        all the other nuances as well. The computer may also find the one, that your life won't become boring with.
        Another computer program may help with other life decisions, like what education to pursue. Let's say, this
        computer program acts in your best interest. Let's also say, that everyone is still accountable and has common
        sense, and knows, that what the computer says is just a recommendation and is limited to the knowledge of the
        program. Does this world still contain free will? Yes, but with a twist. If everything is automated, decisions
        can be outsourced to a computer, you don't have to take responsibility anymore. If this computer program finds
        the right one, accounting for everything, it removes the “black points” from your life and makes it less
        interesting. That's the problem. </p>


    <p>That's why we need a world, with less extreme suffering, scarcity, uncertainty, and meaning. Welcome to our
        current world! Here every day is interesting, … </p>

    <p>Only reality is good.</p>


    <h1><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Appendixes and comments</h1>
    <h1>You knew it all along</h1>

    <p>Well, let's take something without any flaws. A white square. It's boring. Let's make it unperfect by adding some
        structure, a few lines, and shades. It's still boring, there are no “black spots”, something to discover. Now,
        let's take a real photo, it's already a lot better because it's real and full of flaws. Now, let's take a photo,
        that you took yourself and is most likely a lot worse than the photo from a real photographer, but you are
        willing to trade imperfection for a higher dose of reality and imperfection. A perfect unperfect photo from a
        photographer is most emotionally worth less because you did nothing for it (for example stock photos), it
        doesn't exist for you or because of you, just as with any other “free” things, you have to attach meaning to
        things first, and meaning comes only from reality. That's why you won't print a stock photo and put it in a
        frame, you will put your own photos into a frame. </p>

    <p>What else?</p>

    <p>If there was one thing that you would change about the world if you constructed it from the ground up, what would
        it be? After you set all the rules, there would be no way for you to interfere. You would also get only 1 try.
        Pick wisely.
    </p>

    <h1>Don't dye your hair</h1>

    <p>There is a video game which is called Minecraft. It enables players to explore an infinite and interesting world
        with many different things to do and discover, while the best thing about the game is the freedom of the player.
        The player is able to build systems, develop themselves, build things, and explore the world. But why, should
        you play video games, if you can pursue those things in Reality? That's what I have been doing all the time
        because there is no point in pursuing something unreal. </p>


    <h1>Paradise, what's that</h1>
    <p>
        From a broader perspective, paradise is a place, where heaven, nature and earth intersect each other. The chaos
        hereby ceases to exist, as chaos constitutes threat and threat doesn't exist in paradisical perfection. It's
        therefore safe, and the word for paradise stems from the words “walled garden” Walls are always temporary and
        instable, even if their physical form last millennia, like the Chinese wall, eventually every wall is destroyed
        and crossed. The wall just makes it more tempting to escape, therefore a perfect world would collapse
        immediately. <em>Walled “paradises” collapsed already 30 years ago.</em> In the bible, one of the first things that
        takes place is Eve not having the will to resist infinite well-being in the paradise, and eating form the tree
        of life, gaining consciousness and getting thrown out of the paradise, the garden of Eden. As a consequence,
        something happens, if there was nothing happening in a perfect world, there would be no content for a bible!
    </p>

    <p>Sometimes, paradise seems tempting as a temporary escape in the presence of danger, hence “walled garden” This
        however reveals something else: paradise has to be earned. Only if you experience something chaotic, desires for
        infinite order start to materialize. When these desires of resting and pleasure are fulfilled, you will notice,
        that you miss the turbulences and action
