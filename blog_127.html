    <h1>Leaving people behind</h1>

    <p>One day I decided to stop sleeping through and to remember my dreams. And yes, I'm entitled to just decide and it
        ends up materializing, as I've deluded myself into thinking that I can control my mind. When I sleep, I don't
        dream of hot girls, instead, I think of problems I have so that I can wake up with an uneasy feeling. I confront
        reality, I do not wish to numb myself. Today I dreamt something interesting.</p>

    <p>I remember there being a sandy beach, like in a typical tourist hotspot. It was dark, no stars were visible since
        dim light was emitted by colorful and distant points everywhere along the shore. The water is black in the night
        and peaceful. On this beach, I encountered a young man and he cried; I asked him what's the problem. Turns out
        everyone had forgotten his birthday in addition to him living a pretty meaningless life. He explained, felt like
        killing himself. I didn't hesitate to call out his weakness. I told him that that's because he's a loser and
        everyone left him behind. Lying would have made things worse. I explained that no one cares about anyone, no one
        wakes up and thinks: ‘I need to make this guy rich.' It's simple. Either you make sure there are people in your
        life who care about you or you live a life where everyone abandons you. I continued, that the solution to his
        problem is simply to become the alpha male and to take control of one's life. If you're the winner, you never
        have to worry about anyone forgetting your birthday. You either win or accept defeat, get left behind, and
        linger until death arrives. </p>

    <p>Dreams are not random. The location looked a lot like the places I've been to. The conversation is similar to the
        one I had yesterday where I said the same things to him. My 16th birthday was forgotten as well, so that's not
        random in that dream either. My family only got the insight that I was turning 16 many hours after I left to go
        to school. In school, no one remembered anything, except for one guy, so it's my fault I hid it. I must still be
        happy to have nothing, that gives reason to do things. I doubt my 17th birthday will be forgotten and any other
        birthday past that. You are indeed alone, especially when you haven't built yourself up. You may think that your
        family or friends want your best, but chances are they don't wake up thinking: ‘I need to make Kiryl rich
        today!' If you don't care about your life, no one else will. </p>

    <p>I love my friends, and I know that they want the best for me. It is nice to spend time with them. But still, I
        don't think we are compatible anymore. I asked them and all of them want to become proletarians, they want to
        live invisible and peaceful lives! When I talk about my lack of discipline, they talk about their nonexistent
        one. Don't get me wrong. They don't drag me down, they don't want to make me do things I don't want to, they
        don't try to change me, and neither do they interfere in my plans for the future. Despite their goodwill and
        positivity, were now incompatible. I want to get more out of life, they don't want to. At my core, I feel
        superior and with friends, I feel loving - the issue is, that makes it difficult to live a meaningful life, as
        I'm being inauthentic and knowing I'm lying to myself causes useless mental suffering. If you love, why not
        enjoy comfort and kill the ambition that comes from a feeling to live up to one's self-perception? Contradicting
        one's self-perception makes one depressed, hence, I can't detach myself from my core that wants me to achieve
        enormous success. There were a few months where I lived detached from my core and those weren't good times. I
        was compatible with my friends from September to now, yet now I've returned to my core and feel strong again.
    </p>

    <p>There is no slip without intent, a random comment one hasn't thought about reveals the person's true self. The
        identities of my friends contradict mine. When I say, listening to music makes you a peasant, it makes you
        content with life I know bloody well what I'm talking about. If I say, headphones are for weaklings, you better
        listen! Headphones seem to be the absolute detachment from reality into one of hedonism only. If you need music
        to run, you're weak. If you can't entertain yourself with your voice that tells you to keep going, you're weak.
        If we should ever meet in person and I see you wearing headphones while you're not a millionaire or with a
        six-pack, I will judge you and think that you're a loser. Another example. There's a central philosophical
        question and that's whether free will exists. A few months ago, I talked to a pretty girl and she started to say
        something like ‘Well, I'm not so sure whether free will is real' and then kept talking some random philosophical
        nonsense. I don't know whether free will exists and I don't care if it does. I only know that every person who
        doesn't believe in free will is a loser. People who don't believe in free will tend to also believe that the
        birth lottery matters a lot. I want to deny even that, are there no billionaires in India or what? When you
        start to think in this determined and material fashion, you stop taking responsibility and linger around doing
        nothing. This is not something I like to argue about, this is an axiom. I refuse to believe in things that make
        me weak. Someone may criticize my texts because I spread the idea that I was able to remove my traumas without
        any help and without even talking to anyone about it, not to mention refusing to get professional help. Turns
        out, I simply didn't care about science. I deluded myself that I was able to break free and I was proven
        correct. You are mistaken into believing in anything that takes power and responsibility away from you and you
        are a true loser if you try to instill your unproductive beliefs into others, thinking that you are smart for
        propagating ‘free will is an illusion'. If you refuse to be accountable for everything in your life and refuse
        to take control over it, you're a loser, you can't be helped. If you tell me, I should stop blaming myself all
        the time, you're a crab trying to pull me down. I will have to leave you behind. Stay away from me with your
        witchcraft! Comments like ‘you should eat chocolate, otherwise you'll have a massive burnout' or ‘don't exhaust
        yourself too much' from a person who did zero pushups in the last month is a crab. If you tell me: “Technology
        is the future, so you should learn to integrate it into your life early on” - you're a loser. You can't skip
        learning what 5 + 5 is just because there are calculators, thinking that ‘you need your brain to solve other
        problems'. You don't get smart using the calculator. Sure, I'm allowed to speed up my programming with AI tools,
        but only because I know how to program without it. Learning to program with AI from the start is useless, you
        will stay dumb. I could go on with this argumentation but I know that there will be a random crab trying to
        argue with me. I think it should be common sense that at first, you learn, then, after mastering it, you use
        tools to make you faster. If that's not common sense, you're hopelessly stupid. Can't you have the humility to
        admit being wrong at least once? At this level, I don't know who I'm even arguing with, it's just a waste of
        time. Another popular example of low-level people wasting my time is if they say some nonsense about social
        media being good for relaxing and unwinding or that it's useful to stay connected and - I kid you not - to stay
        informed or to learn new things. I find it amusing if someone tells me about critical thinking and then argues
        exactly like a textbook would without putting any soul into it or without having an original thought ever,
        instead having thoughts like everyone else with ‘balanced views' It's hopeless for them. I know that I'm not
        making myself popular with this text. They're losers. I'm wasting my time trying to help them or to convince
        them otherwise. </p>

    <p>If you think that I'm close-minded, you're a robot, the opposite is true. I was open-minded and listened to
        losers and it made my life go downhill. Time to leave them behind and to stop listening to them. Time to be
        close-minded to everyone who is behind, even if they have my best interest at heart. </p>

    <p>I made the mistake of caring about these people and making them my friends. They don't try to change my beliefs
        or me, but still, they have this deep weakness inside of them that will inhibit them from doing anything
        remarkable, ever. They truly believe that headphones are ok. Good luck with that level of thinking. I'm wasting
        my time if I talk to them about life if their thinking is so unproductive. I don't want to spend any further
        resources preaching why gratitude is good and why you're not allowed to waste your time scrolling social media,
        also not on my blog. That should be obvious. If your foundation is missing that, I don't care anymore. It's
        hopeless for them. I'm leaving them behind. </p>

    <p>You are indeed the average of the people you spend time with, so, I better isolate myself and listen to
        successful people in books and on the internet, just as I started years ago and it served me well. </p>

    <p>I'm never negative; you will not catch me complaining or insulting anyone. I'm always grateful and respectful,
        even if I don't quite respect that person. On my blog, I sometimes complain, insult, and shout, but never in
        person. When I complain in my texts, I only do so to reflect and to improve. However, I've had a few moments
        where I complained and it attracted more negativity, that's why I know for sure I'm allowed to complain. Do you
        know what happens when one of your friends complains? You make clear to the universe that you are open to
        negative energy. Hence, you get that negativity. Demons get energy from you suffering through the negativity you
        absorb. When you open yourself to this kind of energy, that's when you start to collect misfortunes.
        Unfortunately, one of my friends constantly complains. Coincidentally, she is always depressed for no reason.
        She attracts that negativity. I do not need negativity in my life. I shame myself for talking badly about my
        ‘friends' behind their backs. Some of my friends aren't negative, but weak instead. One of them is very positive
        but struggles to break free from his digital addiction, which has the same impact as a negative person. It makes
        my discipline a lot less stable and makes me hate myself. Weakness is equal to negativity. I can't imagine a
        successful person complaining. Energy can't be destroyed, it can be converted into either complaints or success.
        Some weaklings may then try to point out that this paragraph wants toxic positivity or some other nonsense and I
        won't comment on that since I'm not immature. That's a pity to bond with friends just to realize that you will
        have to leave them behind a few months later. But that's life, either you outgrow your friends or you don't
        grow. </p>

    <p>How do you deal with people who you are outgrowing? Be a man about it. You know what needs to be done, stop lying
        to yourself! I developed a lot by being social, but now I have to face isolation again. I know isolation is
        harmful, but it's the lesser evil. I have no friends anymore, I don't like them anymore. Admittedly, I couldn't
        ever have trusted them with my life to begin with. It's fully my fault, I grew. Now I have to make sure I don't
        end up as the person from my dream and improve enough to be a better friend myself and to find real ones. I feel
        excited about it and feel zero regret, that's how I know it's the right thing. Even when I felt some hesitation,
        I would still know what was right. I didn't abandon them out of the blue, rather over the past month, I
        struggled to keep conversations because we diverged so much since I started to return to strength after my
        struggle since September. In my weaker times, we were compatible. Now I will have to leave them behind and move
        into darkness. With that, I will also leave behind stupid people who would try to argue for headphones. If you
        can't walk away, what can you do anyway? - Be willing to make sacrifices and to stand up to do not what is
        comfortable, but that which you know is right! </p>

    <p>Despite everything, there's a friend I didn't diverge from. He is also the one who helped me to become social in
        the first place, in December of 2022 by listening and not judging. </p>
