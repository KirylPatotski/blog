        content="If you have enough motivation and fix your life, you will realize that you never wanted to have free time in the first place. Free time is supposedly desired, if you work for someone else, meaning you lack motivation, but that's not true, because leisure time is actually the worst time of the day.">

    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Work-life balance is a lie unless you are a slave.</span></h1>

    <h1>The Work-Balance won't make you happy</h1>

    <p>Be careful what you wish for, because it may come true, <em>be careful of what you think because it will come
            true.</em></p>

    <p>I think that work-life balance as concept is a rather an ideology to comprehend truths that are undesirable. The
        aim of this text is to present a better alternative to work-life balance, which is compatible with extreme
        performance.</p>

    <p>Why I wrote this text</p>

    <p>Whenever I go to school, I see how no one is motivated to do basically anything, even though it's in the people's
        rational self-interest to perform well in school in order to get a more advanced profession, which will help
        them to get free. Not so fast. This phenomenon can also be explained, or at least viewed from another valid
        perspective as well. For example, in 8th grade, I was 13 years old and I started to learn how to program and
        started my entrepreneurial journey. When I went back to school, it lost its highest instance of meaning, because
        I found something more valuable and moved on.</p>

    <p>The same thing is able to happen with your work, if you lose faith in it or move on, your desire to work in this
        specific job disappears. This can happen for a lot of reasons, maybe a shift in your life, the job's atmosphere,
        the colleagues, or maybe you simply picked the wrong job because you have been tricked into it by your
        environment. Whenever something becomes meaningless, it becomes hard to further invest effort into it, since the
        brain isn't meant to do useless work, and doing useless work is also against the law of the path of least
        resistance.</p>

    <p>But this isn't inevitable and not entirely correct either. Because there are many more illusions hidden in this
        whole idea of work-life balance next to meaning. Picking a meaningful job should be your absolute priority, but
        there is more to it.</p>

    <p>You have been lied to</p>

    <p>I used to be a loser, before 2020 I would come home from school and waste my time, as I had nothing meaningful,
        and if you lack meaning, you distract yourself with pleasure. At the time I liked to be in school more than at
        home. While this had many other reasons as well, I think the most significant reason will reveal the biggest
        lie. - Free time is worthless. </p>

    <p>Because I had nothing to do, my mind could go anywhere at any time and this is a huge problem because only a
        focused mind is capable of happiness in the first place. The mind doesn't even have to be occupied with work,
        love for example can do the same effect - Are you happier in traffic or while reading? While driving there is
        nothing to focus on and therefore your mind goes anywhere, but the vast majority of the thoughts are negative,
        so free time actually becomes the time of unhappiness.</p>

    <p>I admit that this idea is difficult to grasp, because it may contradict everything you have ever believed to be
        true. But this turns out to be true if you look closer and this knowledge will help you to construct a better
        life. </p>

    <p>I am a 16-year-old kid, others may not take me that seriously, but my blogs need to go a little deeper every
        time. The media and the companies are in the interest of promoting work-life balance because more people are
        going to have time, and free time, which needs to be filled. In this case, it's no wonder that it gets pushed so
        hard because if more people get miserable in their free time because they have nothing to do, they will need to
        buy products or services to overcome this boredom and need to spend time-consuming content. But consumption is
        the exact opposite of creation and I enjoy writing more than I do reading. It gets even worse when you realize
        that work-life balance is used to promote undesirable work, to make it appear more desirable - It's tempting you
        into wasting your life in your work as well as your free time - that's why the concept of work-life balance only
        makes sense if you are a slave after all work doesn't have to be meaningful and you still get to rest…</p>

    <p>It's not sensible to do not meaningful work and then claim that your free time fulfills you, because the work has
        to fulfill you and not your free time, because free time as a concept in the modern world should rather be
        called “mindless consumption time”. If you do work in your free time, then this work is what fulfills you. </p>

    <p>The other way</p>

    <p>There is a difference between having no free time and working all day long. A family is still more important than
        a career because a career is just relevant in its own system while a family is absolute to your life. Think of
        your 80-year-old self. No one ever says they should have invested more time in their career because pursuing a
        career is the wrong way to live. But your life quality will improve if you do everything to its respective limit
        and focus. That means, on some days you do meaningful work until you no longer can and spend time with your
        family then, and not the typical 8-hour work day. If your 8-hour work day makes you unhappy, this will also
        affect every other area of your life, which makes the 8-hour work day inherently incompatible with a happy and
        fulfilling life. Your 8-hour workday will make you unhappy because it is impossible to create deep meaning in
        that time, otherwise, you would be doing it all day long on your own.</p>

    <p>Most people do undesirable work and cope with free time, which makes them more unhappy and makes them waste their
        money and time on useless stuff instead of chasing their dreams. If there is something important enough, you
        will have fun working on it, and if you get exhausted, you won't waste your time on the internet but rather go
        on a walk or write. </p>

    <p>No one dreams of a life that consists of undesirable and meaningless work, combined with hours of mindless
        stimulation after it. People dream of working every day on something meaningful and focused all the time. No one
        wants to be distracted all the time. </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>I do acknowledge that this scenario of meaningful work is an ideal and work-life balance presents the better
        choice for most cases - but most cases are not what people look up to, because these are not ideals to strive
        towards. Nothing extraordinary comes from the ordinary. Meaningful work, which you will do even in your free
        time is something you should desire - also if this meaning comes from being a mother. </p>

    <p>It is possible to live that ideal and there is <em>no way back</em> once you have achieved it. Success is the
        pursuit of a worthy ideal.</p>
