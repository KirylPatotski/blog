    <h1>Urgency/Importance method</h1>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>At first, you should write down every single task, that comes into your mind, even if you think that some of the
        tasks may be useless. It's important to write them down anyway because you shouldn't constrain your thoughts if
        you want real results. You can write in the shortest form possible, for example: “finish assignment” or “create
        YouTube video on priorities” </p>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="item">
                <img src="images/prioritize/Importance 2.png">
                <div class="tooltip">The diagram, after you add the task</div>
            </div>
        </div>
  
    <p>Now, after you write your tasks down, it's time to organize them. List them and position these tasks in an
        importance/urgency diagram. The tasks with a low urgency and low importance have no priority, meaning that you
        should cut them out because you should only do tasks that have a high importance and high urgency first. Tasks,
        that are unimportant and unurgent have a low priority, and should not be done first. If you map the tasks, you
        may notice that some tasks have a low priority now, but they will shift towards a high priority, or resolve
        themselves. That's why you need to work on the high-priority task first because that will avoid risk. The
        diagonal of this chart is the priority.</p>

        </div>

    <p>Now, after you have mapped your tasks, you should take the tasks with the highest priority and formulate them in
        great detail, for example, “Create a YouTube video about priorities” would be formulated in: record clips, and
        speak through the script 5 times, record me explaining everything, create a thumbnail, create description,
        create a title, upload, edit, animate, cut, create a short… Every task you have listed should be so
        insignificant, that you almost hesitate to write it down. After you have done that, make yourself accountable by
        estimating the time it takes to complete these tasks and by adding deadlines. You can keep yourself accountable
        with these measures and therefore add certainty and pressure, which are going to make you much more productive.
    </p>

    <p>Accountability and deadlines are going to create high productivity and when you have also found the highest
        priority tasks, you will be able to deliver amazing results - and have more time to rest.</p>
