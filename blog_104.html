    <p>ONLY READ THIS TEXT IF YOU HAVE EXCELLENT MENTAL HEALTH AND DON'T READ IT BEFORE BED. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Desperate awakening.</strong></em> There are two hostile brothers in the mind which need, and you
        always favor one of them. These two brothers dislike each other, yet when left alone establish similar results,
        with the only difference being that one of them is inauthentic. A person who reads the text “Desperate
        Awakening” will instantly understand which conflict I'm referring to. This conflict is rooted in a fundamental
        spiritual assumption: the belief that your mind craves presence and doesn't like to be sunk in its own thoughts.
        There is a subtle explanation and this explanation also explains why institutionalized religion provides little
        spiritual value and why nihilism feels depressive. The reason constitutes the deep fear of mortality and there
        are two ways to resolve this conflict, as the existence in permanent liminality is impossible. Liminality refers
        to “space in between”. It is inherently unstable, and itself leads to existential doubt. Yet, a bit of
        liminality is necessary, because without liminality there is no other side, no “space in between,” hence overly
        institutional spiritual enlightenment constitutes a flawed concept. </p>

    <p>The liminality of the mind expresses itself, yet is not limited to the form of, mental illness, addictions,
        worries, fear, doubt, insecurity, perpetual overthinking, and surprisingly, useless work. The first solution is
        to escape this space in between means to murder the mind. Murder sounds cruel, yet most people are following
        this route because they don't like themselves and because destroying something is easier than building something
        - most people are brutally short-sighted. They try to instill utter passivity in their consciousness so that
        they won't need to face the brutal cognition of one's mortality. They fear thoughts so much that they try to
        stop thinking. They try to turn it off by going on vacation or parties, they crave going to the cinema as it's a
        distraction. They crave intense stimulation and pleasure to forget their problems, to kill their consciousness,
        as otherwise, it would bring pain they never learned to handle. Yet, this way of bringing your mind to total
        passivity is inauthentic, because it suppresses the natural desire for mental presence, for being mentally
        online. That means this is the brother that no one likes, yet you may be the one preferring him.</p>

    <p>The other brother is opposed to the way as suppression tends to worsen things. Hence the alternative involves
        bringing the mind to the desired presence with the help of spirituality and meditation. They are brothers
        because they are fundamentally similar, they both remove thoughts, merely the means to the ends conflict with
        each other. One tries to numb the mind to stop it from thinking and the other one tries to establish maximum
        presence to stop the mind from thinking. The path of the middle, which is passive constant thinking, is the
        worst in any case. One of the biggest problems in philosophy is the question of how to know when one has reached
        the end, one can never predict the precise location of the deepest point, the point of highest stability.
        Applied to this case it means that most people prefer a local high rather than a global one, because the local
        high, the first brother is closer. They chose to go to the cinema rather than to get spiritual enlightenment.
    </p>

    <p>After reflecting, spiritual enlightenment was the most important event in my life and it happened in September
        2023 after having meditated for countless hours. I have changed more radically in no more than two seconds than
        I did in the previous two years, as since then I stopped thinking. I'm in a constant state of flow. My ego is
        dead and I see myself from a rather external perspective. Spiritual enlightenment makes you feel calm as the new
        default, you can choose when to think and what to think. Enlightenment makes you realize that reality only
        exists in your mind. I didn't have a single thought in hours, which allowed me to start writing and the keyboard
        became my new brain, it became the medium to think for me, yet my mind was empty. My mind goes directly from the
        universe to the keyboard, without thoughts in the middle, I am one with the environment, there is zero
        inauthenticity. If you were to measure my brain waves and teach a computer how to interpret the signals, it
        would output this text with precision, only with a few spelling mistakes. Imagine what kind of gift it is to be
        intelligent enough to have thoughts that equal this text and then be able to control them. </p>


    <p><em><strong>Dead eyes.</strong></em> Every spiritual text applies to intelligent people, while intelligence
        refers to excellence in at least some fields, whether it's social, musical, logical, common sense, or
        intellectual. Some people can't believe it, but some people live completely without thoughts. They don't live
        without thoughts because they didn't learn to gain absolute control over their mind and got spiritually awakened
        to realize the insignificance of life's triviality, rather they are too stupid to have thoughts in their mind.
        In my experience, around 30% of the common population have no thoughts. They can't achieve mental presence,
        because they don't have a soul, they don't have a mind comminating with the universe in the first place. If such
        a person were to read a text like this one, they would likely know the word “meditation” or “spiritual
        awakening,” and they may even know their definition, yet they will have no mental image of what these things
        represent. The attentive reader may have noticed the similarity to the first brother, the one who fakes mental
        calmness by numbing himself and that's the precise embodiment of the first brother. When looking at such a
        person, they express calmness and an inexperienced person will have difficulties distinguishing between them.
        You see, the first brother is inauthentic, yet to sense inauthenticity it takes experience, intelligence, and
        spiritual enlightenment. </p>

    <p>Yet, this text isn't called 'dead eyes' for nothing. You can sense the stillness of the individuals by looking in
        their eyes and most of the time it takes no more than 50 milliseconds, you see it instantly. The individual
        needed to learn to find trustworthy comrades and looking at someone with dead eyes will create an intense
        feeling of unease. The eyes are a direct extension of the brain; hence they reveal everything. Most of the time,
        the first milliseconds of an encounter reveal everything about a person. A person who expresses authentic
        calmness, the second brother, will have eyes filled with life, yet an inauthentic person will have dead eyes.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>The zombie.</strong></em> The result is sinister and many people fall for people as such, those are
        the ones ending up in rather uncomfortable situations, such as abusive relationships. It brings us back to the
        description of the authentic brother, the second one. I described, how I have no thoughts because I am in unity
        with my environment. Yet, the zombie is in a unity with his environment as well, yet in a different kind. The
        zombie is in unity with his environment without authenticity and the necessary death of his ego. Meaning, that
        the zombie will view everything around him as a means to end, as an object. He will be the one that abuses
        everything, and his eyes will be dead and his subduction hostile. People who spend time with this special kind
        of person get corrupted themselves. The zombie will look at you as if you were an object, hence his eyes won't
        be filled with life.</p>

    <p>The zombie in its classical definition describes a person that exists without a soul, a person that exists and
        reacts, yet doesn't feel anything. In philosophy, the zombie is seen as an embodiment of the true nature of
        reality, as the existence of zombies would imply that there must be a force outside the physical world and that
        thoughts aren't just a product of the brain. The spiritual zombie is similar, it assumes that some people don't
        have a soul and are still human, thus they have a corrupted energy. The definition of a zombie from movies is
        quite similar when considering the implications, it's the dead that aren't buried. Going back to the spiritual
        and philosophical perspective, they are dead from this one, their mind is dead, hence you see death when you
        look them in the eyes and feel repelled. </p>

    <p>The zombie has some traits which are the following. The zombie is spiritually, mentally, and morally dead, which
        means, that they keep denying everything, they deny God, responsibility, and improvement. They are complacent,
        lazy, lack motivation for anything, don't help anyone, follow mobs and trends, are close-minded, and fail at
        everything they do. Despite everything, some of them develop skills and become highly dangerous, they know how
        to hide their nature. </p>

    <p>There is an excellent writer, his name is Goethe. In his work, Faust I, the devil expresses these words: <em>“The
            spirit I, that endlessly denies. And rightly, too; for all that comes to birth is fit for overthrow, as
            nothing worth; Wherefore the world were better sterilized; Thus all that's here as Evil recognized Is gain
            to me, and downfall, ruin, sin the very element I prosper in.” </em></p>

    <p><em><strong>A terrible vision.</strong></em> I'm spiritually enlightened, i.e. I have no useless thoughts and
        calmness is my new default. Yet, this night was different, because I didn't fall asleep calm and free of
        thoughts, instead, a vision kept coming back. </p>

    <p><em>Imagine you are walking and the sky is rose, slowly fading into a grey and you are approaching a piece of
            forest on your walk. The cool wind blows at your face, the leaves swoosh, and the stream is in a flow, it's
            one with the riverbed, and it becomes the riverbed. You also hear some drops from the melting snow falling
            to the ground. You hear a distant, yet omnipresent static, caused by far-away human activity. Yet, suddenly
            things start to change. It gets darker minute by minute and the forest path becomes seemingly tighter. The
            brown leaves become black due to the darkness. You take out your torch, yet realize that you still see no
            more. The sky is free of stars and the moon is missing, there is only your path and the forest on both sides
            that keeps becoming less defined and scarier, to a point where you are too scared to look to the side, you
            fear your periphery field of view, hence, you only dare to look straight and feel like increasing your pace.
            Yet, after going faster for no more than 200 meters you feel overwhelmed, so you restore your speed. That
            fear isn't going anywhere, yet you are fully present. You are alone in the dark. Slowly everything turns
            quiet. From your periphery you spot two lights, they look like car lights, so you mistake them as such, with
            the only difference that you notice something off - you don't hear the sound of a car and these two points
            are very sharply defined. The two points are orange. Desperately, you try not to look and to walk straight
            with a quickened pace. You start to think that you never want to go alone in the forest again. Yet, you look
            to the side and feel a bit of relief. The two orange dots have a round shape, a cute round shape that is
            slightly thicker towards the bottom. Once looking for a few more seconds you get a deeply eerie feeling,
            these orange dots have a corrupted familiarity, traitors from within. The orangeness of these two dots has
            something magical about it, you can't stop looking. These eyes don't look like the eyes of the beast which
            are narrow and tapered at the top and glowing in a bloodthirsty red. These eyes look peaceful, a bit too
            peaceful, why did everything turn quiet? The black creature of human stature with these orange eyes walks
            past you and when the creature looks you in the eyes directly you feel a strong sensation of fear, of fear
            which you can't explain. Yet, nothing happened to you, you got lucky. <br><br>You don't go for walks in the
            dark alone anymore, because you have learned your lesson. This creature never comes back directly, it's gone
            forever. The creature itself has no shape, it's blurry, yet it's able to occupy the bodies of others and you
            start to notice these creepy orange eyes in your woman and sooner in more and more people because they
            absorbed this energy that this shapeless demon was. </em></p>


    <p><em><strong>A warning to all women.</strong></em> Whenever I encounter such a zombie as described previously, I
        feel a rather strong sensation of fear and repel. They give off a similar energy to mine, which means they
        reflect it. Yet, they don't reflect it with goodwill, instead, they return a corrupted version of this same
        energy. Because the energy they give off feels similar to your own, they will be able to exploit you. The energy
        is not equal, but similar because it is poisoned, it is corrupted, an embodiment of sin. This is what looking at
        the devil looks like; it invokes unconstrained fear. By no means am I physically weak and mentally unstable.
        Yet, I feel a strong fear and dislike towards zombies as such. The zombie energy is contagious, such as any
        energy. People who spend a lot of time with zombies get dead eyes themselves. They get eyes that look like the
        eyes of the shapeless creature with orange eyes or of a porcelain doll. </p>

    <p>I have developed a strong sensitivity to certain energies because I need to protect myself from them in the
        future, yet most young people lack this experience. </p>

    <p>Especially women can be corrupted by this hostile energy because they are missing their own similar energy to
        counter it. The zombie, after all, is the first brother and seems to be calm. Stillness is the spiritual
        masculine; hence it's lurking. This calmness feels great, it feels safe, and the zombie gives off the energy of
        a strong person. Yet, his eyes are still dead. These dead eyes add mystery because not a lot of people make one
        see death when looking them in the eyes - death is dangerous, hence, it becomes even more attractive for women.
        They don't want to think, they want to be seduced by this dangerous individual, and they secretly want to be
        abused. Thus, their lives become vicious circles. After all, they probably have never seen the second brother,
        the authentic enlightened, i.e. their feminine innocence makes them susceptible. However, when the women notice
        that something about this person is off, they are often too much of a pushover to set things straight, they are
        too tolerant on the wrong end. The dumb women are going to be arrogant; the smart woman will think about the
        exact type of person I'm referring to and take action. However, in most cases, it's too late, the energy was
        already absorbed too much and the women lose their souls to a person with dead eyes. </p>

    <p>A lot of women will try to argue for their dead-eyed men, as “they know him better than everyone else and no one
        understands anything,” and those women are too stupid to be helped. It's their fault and they deserve the abuse.
        I have seen some things already and I know precisely what kind of person is categorically hostile. But this
        knowledge isn't exclusive, a lot of people have it, maybe even the majority. The first impression reveals more
        than getting to know that person, the manipulation of a person begins to infect you as you get to know them
        better. You will start talking about life, about what you desire and love, and that zombie will share their more
        or less shallow with you, and you will start to forget how problematic that zombie is in the first place. Then,
        when the manipulation kicks in, you will start to develop a sort of love because their energy is draining and so
        you give your energy to them, it will become hard to break free and that will lead to abuse, I know such a case.
        Because that hostile energy shapes the personality of women, they become inclined to desire more abuse. Yet,
        this is where the stupidity of these women kicks in, because they don't want to see and they don't want to learn
        from their mistakes, they keep getting into abusive relationships over and over again - secretly they crave it.
        And I know an example here as well, too well and this example made me the person I am today. </p>

    <p>Using this knowledge, I gave myself the pleasure of getting to know a so-called 'dead-eyed' person a bit better
        by paying more attention to him. </p>

    <p><em>As I skipped 9th grade and went directly into 10th grade, I didn't care about school at all. Zero. I have not
            a single memory from that time in 10th grade except for some stressing liminality. Here is what's
            interesting. Ethics class was always two classes mixed, and that person was the only one I remembered,
            because of his noticeable negative behavior. We were supposed to give a presentation about a utopia that we
            constructed ourselves and that zombie didn't present anything, instead he corrupted his file so that he
            would have a valid excuse Imagine being the only student remembered, and that for your negative behavior!
            Now I know him a bit better, for the third year already and I must tell you that such red flags keep
            surfacing. He is a gambling addict, makes others do things for him, takes drugs, beats his girlfriend, and
            cheats on tests. Well, if beating your girlfriend isn't the ultimate proof of a rather objectified view of
            the world… Those people fail at everything they do, they are good at nothing. The first impression was the
            one that turned out to be correct.</em></p>

    <p>Yet, ironically, those dead-eyed individuals are often the ones who have the highest popularity. That's because
        some people are corrupted themselves and that's why they find that energy to match theirs or they are subject to
        their seduction, to their manipulation. Spending time with them is destructive, being friends with them rots the
        soul, and being in love with them kills the value of one's limited life. </p>

    <p><em><strong>They have a shallow inauthentic way of life. </strong></em> The only way to escape this hostile
        influence once it's too late is to get the help of God, because your soul must be cleaned. However, for those
        beacons of inauthenticity, there is no hope. I would also dare to say that those kinds of people would have been
        kicked out of the tribe thousands of years ago due to their purely evil nature. What does a tribe need a person
        that fails at everything and abuses everyone around him? They are not human in the classical sense, and that's
        why they can't be saved, those are people without a soul, hence purely evil. </p>

    <p>The person born or developing as such will have an incomplete life, they will never be able to live a deep,
        fulfilling, authentic life, because they get trapped by their own energy. Because they lack intelligence, those
        people lack self-awareness, hence they will never see the need to improve in the first place. They will think
        that the existence of a person without a soul is the way to be. A soul is necessary.</p>

    <p>As multiple people pointed out, there is a spectrum between pure good and pure evil. I have to admit this idea to
        be true, yet I have to disagree with a slight aspect. Some people, make you see death when you look them in the
        eyes and that's free of any spectrum, while some people make you see death only to some extent. Those people can
        change, yet the purely evil ones can't be, guess what constitutes the cure? It's spirituality, religion, God,
        and fine arts. Music is not art, at least not the majority of the music on the radio and neither is a picture
        generated by artificial intelligence art because those aren't designed to clean the soul, they are designed to
        entertain. Excellent art can express the positive energy of life, while void art is meaningless and some of them
        make you see death, just like the kind of person I'm depicting here. I want to avoid citing the Bible in this
        text because the second Bible page discusses spiritual awakening, where the people wake up by metaphorically
        realizing that they are naked, something the zombie will never understand. Thinking further, Goethe is the prime example of a
        person who
        understands how arts serve to refine an individual and how it cleans their soul, just as shown in the quote of
        his representation of the devil. The task of praying is to clean your soul, hence, it is similar to the one of
        art, yet both are combined, since churches are often very aesthetic. </p>

    <p><em>Today I went to a Christian Advent church meetup and I didn't find a single zombie there. </em></p>

    <p>Those people are unable to find happiness because they live a life just to harm others, yet this attempt destroys
        them in the end. They have no energy of their own, thus they have to steal it from others. Why don't they have
        energy? Because they are dead in their soul, misaligned with the universe.</p>

    <p>Those are the ones who end up jumping from the bridge at the age of 40 because they, despite
        lacking a soul, often realize the damage they have done and even the evilest person will notice their wrong
        eventually. The dead-eyed person who abused my family and me is now lonely. He has nothing except a mortgage for
        his car his 160kg must somehow fit in, a ruined health and broken mind, and a heart in ashes. That's how the
        life of every zombie ends. They abuse others and it works well, they get pleasure out of it, yet once everyone
        gains more experience, they stop spending time with these people unless they are such zombies themselves, they
        are friends just because they spend time together, those people are truly lost. The women they've abused become
        corrupted, as well as their children, yet the zombie becomes even more corrupted himself. It's hopeless. </p>

    <p>I'm sounding overly negative in this text, yet this is because I'm warning of the worst kind of person. Those
        people are often at the very bottom, yet some of them happen to be skilled and make it to the top, you must be
        careful everywhere. When a person seems to be “off” on the first impression, the first time you look them in the
        eyes, stop getting the temptation to get to know them better. Otherwise, they will ruin you. The eyes tell a lot
        about a person.</p>

    <p><em><strong>The woman I love(d).</strong></em> There is a girl in school whom I had asked out a while ago and she
        rejected me. A few months later she bragged in my presence about this loser she was going to spend her holidays
        with and I couldn't believe it. I knew the person she was referring to and I know that he was one of the three
        extreme zombies in my grade level. I couldn't believe it to the extent that I kept denying it for months, I
        thought, maybe that's a decent guy and I'm simply late and I also thought that it may be her brother. Until I
        saw with my eyes that the worst-case scenario was the true one. She spends time with two of the three dead-eyed
        I know. Just today I saw her with that loser again. I explicitly mention that these two guys give off the same
        energy as the person who abused me in my childhood and if she doesn't listen, then she is dumb and weak, and I'm
        not going to be her “savior.” I don't think I should try to interfere with her destiny which won't differ from
        millions that didn't listen. Now it may already be too late. What do I need a girl for who craves to be abused
        and doesn't listen at the same time? That girl had no problem rejecting me, why is she too stupid to subtract
        obviously harmful people from her life? Don't be tempted to think I'm wrong. I know what I'm talking about and
        everyone who has lived a life with their eyes opened will be able to confirm this. <br> <br><em>A great girl,
            yet with a problem she hasn't fixed yet.</em></p>

    <p><em><strong>To all the girls that could have been mine.</strong></em> If you are too stupid to listen to advice,
        if you are too stupid to create change, at least change your environment when you leave your town to go to
        university or skip 9th grade for example. You are in control of your environment because once you meet new
        people they won't know or care about your past, hence you will choose how they will perceive you. You can't
        desire to be known as the person that is connected to zombies. Changing your environment catalyzes a shift in
        your identity, hence choose your environment wisely, and control the way you want to present yourself to others.
        When you meet a new person, you get to decide which traits make you up. Change yourself before it's too late.
