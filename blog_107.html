    <h1>The art of less</h1>

    <p><em><strong>Most people have zero minimalism in their lives.</strong></em> They consume and indulge without a
        boundary. Their rooms and minds are cluttered - and the time they spend living. They mistake consumerism for
        happiness, seeking comfort at all costs. Those people find pleasure in gifts, shopping, and consumption. They
        want to fill themselves up, since they are empty in their minds, unfulfilled in their destinies. A person with
        these maxims will never accomplish anything, they often won't even try, because they still won't find happiness,
        and their habits will trap them. They will live insignificant lives and look forward to the gifts on Christmas
        and look at their new toys with pride, thinking it's going to make their lives easier, while the TV is running
        in the background and with everyone only half watching. They will get trapped in a meaningless career, because
        after all you have to make money to afford a better life. It's an endless trap. You are working to afford better
        items, in the hope that they are going to bring an improvement. This improvement does arrive, yet then you get
        used to it and it fades into insignificance again. You are working at work you don't like to buy stuff you don't
        need and most people are docile enough to accept and embrace the trap they are falling into, because of their
        mindless pragmatism.</p>

    <p><em>In our kitchen, there is a cooking aggregate, which supposedly simplifies cooking by stirring the dough or
            cutting on its own. It has been standing in our kitchen for 4 years, including now. It has found little
            utility, yet it cost 1500€. Let's say you are making 3000€ per month and work an average job, 8 hours a day.
            To make 1500€, you would have needed to work for 2 weeks, meaning 10 days for 8 hours a day, which equals 80
            hours. What an irony. It takes 70 hours to get a driver's license, 200 hours to write a blog of 160000
            words, 300 hours to learn how to program, and 1000 hours to build a business. These 80 hours were just
            wasted on mindless time for useless consumerism. If something costs 80 hours, it must be life-changing. You
            better stop being an idiot and meditate! What are you working for if that's your reward, some crap you don't
            even use! You would have been better off going for walks in that time, doing less to achieve calmness of the
            mind. Subtract to gain fulfillment and value non-action.</em></p>

    <p><em><strong>A minority of people follow some level of minimalism.</strong></em> At least, this minority
        understands that happiness doesn't derive from materialism, yet their perception of minimalism is rigged
        regardless. They understand that pure consumption will never lead to fulfillment and that non-material items
        will never bring greater joy. </p>


    <p><em>A quite ironic interpretation of what I've just said would be claiming that you should travel instead of
            buying something, yet traveling itself presents a misconception. The fulfillment gained by staying in a
            hotel, going to the beach, and overeating moderate-tasting food is zero. This kind of traveling doesn't
            create any memories, it fuels no inspiration, it instead kills these and rather destroys a life of
            meaning.</em></p>

    <p>Yet, this minority of people understands - owning less will free your mind and remove the drag caused by too much
        ownership. They recognize the vital importance of less, and thus they think before buying something more. They
        visualize whether this item is important enough to be carried over a mountain and buy it only in this case. They
        are intelligent enough to understand the importance of buying valuable items once instead of cheap items twice
        and they try to buy items only when they add authentic meaning to their lives. </p>


        <p></p>
        
    <p><em><strong>The supreme minimalist.</strong></em> One must conclude, that the image of minimalism of this
        minority depicts an incomplete representation of what minimalism truly expresses, their kind of minimalism is
        limited to things to buy, yet there is more to life than just consumption or the denial of such. The supreme
        minimalist views the art of less as the only way to live, as their life philosophy. </p>


    <p><em><strong>Eradicate the search for happiness.</strong></em> Minimalism - that's finding happiness when
        everything is taken away from you, in the bleakest of circumstances. It's about finding joy in the absence of
        pleasure, in discomfort. A lot of people view life as a game to avoid pain and maximize pleasure, yet the
        minimalist throws the concepts of instant and delayed gratification away. What is that makes pain so undesirable
        in the first place? If a life is lived without pleasure because of the circumstances surrounding it, wouldn't a
        view that life is all about seeking pleasure conflict with the notion that a life lived without pleasure is
        still meaningful? I have observed for myself that even delayed gratification is a lie, because you will take the
        work you’ve done in the past for granted and still desire more, perhaps more than you originally expected
        because your standards have raised themselves. When you reach your goals, no matter how hard they seem, you will
        find yourself thinking that it brings you no pleasure after the initial joy wears off. So why do you think that
        life is about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain? When you stop chasing pleasure and simply work towards
        excellence, your life is going to become much more fulfilling and meaningful, when you don't seek pleasure, you
        will gain it, even in the worst of circumstances and so, minimalism is about letting go of expectations, desires
        and the search for happiness. Instead, it is an embracement of pure excellence and discomfort, which leads to
        fulfillment. Today everyone is better off materialistically than the kings a thousand years ago and no one views
        themselves as particularly rich, most people complain instead. Happiness is a choice and you already know it, as
        it comes from fulfillment, which is based on your decisions. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Resourcefulness and a shift of priorities.</strong></em> I'm a simple man, I don't need much. I am
        happy with the life I have built myself and I regret little. I'm happy if my life consists of meditation, walks,
        writing, and some sports, while living in an aesthetically empty room. I enjoy getting up hours before the sun
        rises, I enjoy the quietness that comes from the frozen forests, and I enjoy challenging myself to record
        inspiring videos. I found my dream life, one with peak health and productivity. I don't need warm water, nor do
        I crave parties, I find satisfaction in a simple form of life. Yet, I master everything I touch. In my school of
        eight hundred students, almost everyone knows my name, at least according to my teachers, and many teachers and
        classmates will remember me. I have done many things out of the reach of most things and I know more about life
        than the average person will learn in eighty years of living. I know many things inexplicable to most and I have
        a drive never seen by anyone before. Alone when listing what I do each weekend provides enough content to fuel a
        massive ego, especially when comparing it. Yet, I have also moved beyond that and dropped large parts of it, now
        I don't view myself as an arrogant person, thus, I became an even simpler and happier man, while doing
        everything with unexpected excellence and convincing ease, in classical simplicity, without effort. Do you know
        what happens when you don't need much, and still have plentiful? You gain a life of fulfilling abundance. And if
        you are abundant in everything, it means that you will be able to live in a priority of others. </p>

    <p>On my trip to Austria in May 2023, we only ate breakfast in the hotel, that's it. I didn't take anything to drink
        or to eat with me, because I didn't need anything. Destiny played in my favor, there were water dispensers
        everywhere and it was not hot. As I went to Venice in September 2023 as the final class trip, I learned that I
        don't need anything to eat with me either. Let me tell you something funny. The documentary I've created about
        our trip shows in its first 10 seconds how I put a bottle of water and my computer in the suitcase. Guess what,
        I needed neither of them on the trip. At this point, I don't even know what I need at all. I don't use a phone,
        I barely use the internet, I don't need … </p>

    <p>Let me give you another example. For the same movie I just mentioned, I got a 10€ gift card as a reward from my
        classmates. I went home and I fancied which book to buy. I used the internet, which I despise so much, to look
        up books. “Crime and punishment” cost 9.97€ … then I realized what an idiot I am. What the hell am I spending my
        time on? I'm on the internet fantasizing about which books to buy while having enough books to read already.
        With a hesitation of three seconds, I gave this gift card to my sister. You see, it's nice to receive a gift and
        I'm grateful for it, yet I reflect the joy is greater if I give this gift card to my sister, because I don't
        need much and already have plenty. Believe it or not, destiny played in my favor again. Just a few days later, a
        girl gifted me a philosophical book.</p>

    <p><em><strong>The art of subtraction and focus.</strong></em> There is one reason you are hesitant to live a
        minimalist life. Some people interested in pseudo-science may say it's because you feel incomplete because of
        early childhood trauma and because you've suppressed your subconscious and most people fall for this crap, yet
        there is one reason why you wouldn't dare to live a minimalist existence. It's because your life lacks purpose.
        If you have nothing to do, it's impossible to have a meaningful life. If you have no authentic purpose, it will
        be impossible to have a fulfilling life, thus this whole will be filled with inauthentic stuff, such as the new
        earrings. Even I found it impossible to resist sweets after my first purpose, the app I worked long on failed
        and I had to abandon it. You may think that you have a purpose, but is it an authentic one, does it give you
        something to look forward to? What are you supposed to do when your life has no real purpose, if there is
        nothing you look forward to if you are excited about nothing? That's a goldfish level of existence. I know
        barely any people who have a monumental desire that they don't need anything outside of their purpose. When you
        have discovered your purpose, you don't need anything else outside of it. That's when subtraction is going to
        start.</p>

    <p>Let go of as much as possible. Put your desk in the middle of your room and follow your purpose. You don't need
        to worry about anything else, outside the task that brings you fulfillment. Every legendary person got to their
        legendary status not by addition, but by subtraction, they did nothing outside what screamed to be done. The
        perfect example is authors like Dostoyevsky, who did not do much outside of their work, he wrote every novel as
        if it's his last one, thus every novel is excellent. Do you think he worried about the new dishwasher? Yet, it
        is this subtraction that catalyzed excellence, brought fulfillment, and made him legendary. I doubt that such a
        person will think about how great it is to have the newest phone. Excellence is the art of doing without trying,
        it is the art of effortless action. </p>

    <p><em>The heavier the boat, the slower it is.</em></p>

    <p>This text is based on a video I recorded a few days ago. I desired to record it, yet my family sabotaged my plans
        by turning on the TV for my great-grandmother at full volume. So, I thought I must not be such a pushover and I
        went to the attic with no more than a microphone. You don't need much if you have an authentic purpose and
        everything else is merely a distraction, which will even make you sad. </p>

    <p>There is one task that will cause any improvement in your mental health and it's meditation. Meditation is not
        about adding anything, meditation is archetypical subtraction. It removes annoying worries, useless doubts, and
        unproductive thinking and lets you take back control of your mind. It empties the mind, establishing stillness,
        in which the mind finds fulfillment.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Liberty.</strong></em> Now, what's the goal of minimalism, what's the goal of finding joy in less?
        Let me give you an example. If I don't need warm water, I can bathe in water as cold as it gets. If I don't need
        a backpack, I can walk further. If I don't need a gift, I will view life as a gift. If I let go of the mind's
        negatives, I will have more productive thoughts. A minimalist existence establishes adaptability which results
        in freedom and freedom is vital to a masculine life. If there is nothing to pressure you with, nothing you
        expect, you are free. The art of less is vital to a fulfilling life. </p>
