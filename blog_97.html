    <h1>On the essence of morality</h1>

    <p><strong><em>An introduction.</em></strong> I'm a sick man, a stupid man. I'm lying in bed and having a fever,
        I'm constrained with my body, yet I am smart and arrogant, I refuse my health to influence my metaphysical realm
        of thoughts. I'm conscious. Having predicted sickness at the end of October, I was stupid and did nothing.
        Instead, I drank from a cold stream and called the mistake a shift of purpose. I wanted to stare at the ceiling
        to regain perspective, and now I'm forced to, very funny. Now, I refused weakness: yet ate sugar, coping with my
        sickness. I'm thinking higher of myself than everyone because I act morally, everyone else keeps making the same
        mistakes, living a life of non-unique lessons. I'm arrogant and know everything better than everyone. I thought
        my way often and knew how harmful listening to others can be. But there is something I know better: If something
        isn't moral, why do you keep doing it? I woke up in the middle of the night and refused to turn on the light,
        instead, I kept thinking as I laid in bed, lazy, and full of sweat. Slowly, the sky
        turned white without chroming into red, ever. Now, I have wasted a day, no progress was made and I'm still sick,
        less than before, yet with a fever of 39°C. I'm the moralizer, and I'm in need of a confession, since the
        moralizer secretly craves the things he denies, by denying them, they get a secretive novelty and increase their
        desirability. I hate losers and I know why; I do that because I used to hate being one myself, I know that
        improvement is possible, yet they don't because they are stupid. I protect myself from liminal existence by
        hating it. After all, if someone hates inequality, they aren't subject and catalysts to these problems, they are
        above them. My knees are in pain and so are my eyes, I tried to sleep yet got woken up by distant calls. “You
        need to wake up” and I was sweating, refusing to answer those words directed to me, instead, I was startled
        every time I was called. Walk as far as you can to claim what's yours, yet don't forget to return. Yet, I was
        too proud and got punished for it. At least, I'm honest about it. Now, that I was honest, you may start to love
        me? Now I've improved and become an even better person in the sense that is obvious, yet invisible to most -
        because it's wrong: honesty isn't enough if no improvement follows it. After, all, you need to know your
        weaknesses better than your strengths. And you don't want to live a life of regret, so you better act morally at
        all times. I'm a hypocrite, a walking contradiction, claiming that people simply find it impossible to
        understand me, because no one knows me, not even myself. Yet, I think to know myself, since I'm conscious and
        see things as they are, not as someone wants me to see something. Consciousness, isn't that the key to
        happiness? I conditioned myself to be conscious at all times yet got happier by zero percent. I think to find
        ideas on my own as I can't find their origin, do they come from staring at the ceiling? Probably not. If that
        was correct, why can't a person dying of dementia be creative, how am I able to be creative seemingly without
        any references? Oh, every atheist is stupid, I know better because my vision doesn't lead to the “paradise of
        rational thought”, I'm an orthodox Christian. Well, I must know better, because I'm smart and everyone thinking
        differently simply has no clue about how life works, yet I at 16 years of age know better, after all, I have
        acted against everyone's will often and looked into the mirror, knowing that I was correct. Some like the
        essence of childhood and teenage innocence, yet I live without illusions since I get slapped by reality
        frequently. But, I'm an adult, as I know that the maxim “If we can't explain something, it simply means, that we
        know too little” is a wrong assumption, while the questioning of the obvious always leads to great
        breakthroughs. The sky is turning darker with every letter I'm putting to paper, I see a tree losing its leaves
        on a November day without rain or wind. The air is cold, yet this is excellent because comfort creates weakness
        and removes life's meaning, causing an inauthentic way to live. Before using arguments from authority or
        justification, just look at yourself in the mirror and accept your guilt by trying to justify things rationally.
        After all, if it's rational, how can it be wrong, if you are smart, how can it be wrong? Many -isms seem
        rational and correct, yet they are illusions in the presence of reality. Some unspeakable acts may be justified
        with rational -ism, yet your heart will know the truth, any -ism is in its essence deeply misaligned with human
        nature. If everyone acted morally, or according to some -isms, we would live in paradise. What makes you think
        that paradise is great? Won't people try to kill paradise simply to prove their point and to escape
        indifference, by giving them a fake desire to follow after every authentic one was fulfilled or suppressed? Now,
        the sky is fading into azure, from the white it used to be mere minutes ago. How you do one thing dictates the
        rest. Sometimes, single moments reveal everything about a person and provide turning points, yet often the
        significance of such an event is recognized decades later. When you turn old and do not suffer from cardiac
        disease or cancer, dementia is going to get you and every insignificant memory is going to fade first, revealing
        what was truly important by removing the noise surrounding the event in the blink of an eye. A few hours before
        and after death, you are going to view everything again, for the last time, and surely, you don't want to
        remember yourself as a weak person, who acted immorally, because you tried to stay practical. Amorality
        constitutes inner and outer weakness, are you willing to live as a pushover? Morality needs to be swallowed in
        situations of danger, in the presence of power or liminality, yet at these exact moments, reality reveals who is
        moral and who only pretends to be, when it suits them. If everyone acted morally, such situations wouldn't
        exist, right? Hitherto, such a situation never revealed itself. Well, if everyone acted according to their
        morals or according to the morals of some greater authority instead of looking in the mirror, we would hit
        paradise with precision, thus creating a scenario of meaninglessness and removing the purpose of life. But isn't
        the weak and undisciplined person who views revenge, the act of proving a point, as their moral obligation,
        after all, they think to be smart and right. And acting right, that's the essence of morality? Now, the sky is
        turning too dark and I am forced to turn on the light, to enlighten everyone, supposedly. Do I need to convey
        examples or do you see what will without the presence of moral constraint does? Moral constraints bring meaning,
        as freedom only makes sense in the presence of constraints. Are you able to live a life of immorality, knowing
        that what you do is immoral? After all, you think God doesn't exist, and therefore your moral values don't need
        to exist, only rationality. The rationality of a person is supposed to be the highest moral virtue, and because
        you believe in being able to think, you try to establish your own morality. You want to play the game of life
        and win in the process, yet a life lived without moral ends nihilistically, in misery. For that way of life, you
        truly don't need any morals, yet remember what a life without strong morals looks like. But no, you need to
        think pragmatically and egoistically. The grand inquisitor would have imprisoned Jesus since good values and
        love aren't practical enough, you need to be forced into morality, yet the application of force can be often
        immoral itself. Instead,</p>

    <p>Show people how to live right by living as an example, not by forcing them. Be the change you want to see, and
        show your diary before you dare to critique the world. Well, acting morally at all times is an illusion may the
        pragmatic person say and that's wrong, many people lived their lives perfectly morally aligned and became
        legendary as a result, they showed strength. Look in the mirror to decide if something is moral. Morality is
        strength. </p>

    <p><em>{5:43} Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. {5:44} But
            I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
            them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; {5:45} That ye may be the children of your Father which
            is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on
            the unjust. {5:46} For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the
            same? {5:47} And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more [than others?] do not even the publicans
            so? {5:48} Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</em></p>

    <p>Notes from 18.11.2023. I know that multiple people read this text, and understood little, I probably would have
        lost interest in it
        myself, but let a few days pass by until I create a simple breakdown of this text, see you then, I love you ;-)
    </p>

    <p>Notes from 20.11.2023. So, by now you should already know me quite well and I have promised a detailed breakdown
        of the essence of
        morality in my last text. I stated that this analysis would be published a few days later, yet since you know
        me, you must play with the possibility of the text already summoned - this assumption excels, the analysis was
        already written on the 19th of November. However, after having read over it a few times and with a bit of time
        passing, I've an unsettling feeling, the text seems to be missing something and I don't know what. So, I will
        burn the breakdown and restart, like a Phoenix. Burning it metaphorically will remove the possibility of an
        excuse, forcing me fight till the very end and resulting in victory only.</p>

    <p>Notes from 21.11.2023. The new version still had some issues and I almost wanted to give up. But, haven't,
        because I reminded myself of what it meant to learn. So, I retook courage and continued. </p>

    <h1>An analysis</h1>

    <p>Let's break down the essence of morality step by step. The short text already contains everything, only too with
        little explanation. Every sentence is chosen with careful consideration, and it would take an entire book to
        interpret every word, this is only the essence of morality, meaning, we will take a glimpse into this realm.</p>

    <h1>Shadow</h1>

    <p><strong><em>The shadow is everywhere.</em></strong> It's vital to keep your shadow in mind for the rest of your
        life, everything else is built on it - especially when suppressed. The passage presented a deep and dark side of
        my personality, however, this breakdown is hyper-real, more real than reality, because everyone is functioning
        on the same principles, even if those differ - everyone can identify their dark side in this excerpt.
        Acknowledge, that if you keep denying your dark side you increase its potency because then it will start to
        control you and ultimately lead to immorality. I want to be moral, yet I'm struggling with it, because I don't
        have full control of my shadow.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>On the essence of hatred.</em></strong> Hatred is a “protection mechanism” against the dark side, yet
        you must also grasp why you hate certain things, hate feels similar to fear. Hate will prevent happiness for the
        hater more than for the hated. I know that hating something is immoral, hence I need to improve that as well.
        The thing is, I don't know how I will be able to do it on my own, because my hostile rationality, which I know
        to be harmful to some extent, is deeply rooted. I know that Christianity is about loving others, even the enemy,
        but I'm struggling with it. Of course, I need to change my identity and belief system, but that fear is going to
        remain. Saying that you don't hate losers is one thing, but then going through a city a night alone, it's a real
        challenge to think loving thoughts - but at daytime, they are still the same people.</p>

    <p><em>“I'm the moralizer, and I'm in need of a confession, since the moralizer secretly craves the things he
            denies, by denying them, they get a secretive novelty and increase their desirability. I hate losers and I
            know why; I do that because I used to hate being one myself, I know that improvement is possible, yet they
            don't because they are stupid. I protect myself from liminal existence by hating it. After all, if someone
            hates inequality, they aren't subject and catalysts to these problems, they are above them.”</em></p>

    <p><strong><em>You are no saint.</em></strong> You must understand that you are dangerous, and worse than you
        think, far worse. You wouldn't be some hero fighting against the oppressor, you were 50 times more likely to be
        a guard, a volunteer. No one wants to admit this; hence, it will become more dangerous. There were many
        instances of women being exceedingly more brutal than male guards because women are supposedly tamed - the dark
        side becomes more appealing when swept under the carpet. How do you get to know your dark side? By reading
        fiction and history. My grandmother is a librarian and I'm confident she can confirm that a work's value is
        determined by its ability to clean the soul, called catharsis. While you are reading something you will try to
        fight your shadow in it, however, eventually, you will conclude that the plot was about yourself and you realize
        what it was reminding you of - your shadow. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Knowing your weaknesses and not improving is a sin. </em></strong> If you have the humility to admit
        your dark side and are willing to get to know it better you may encounter a weird phenomenon. You may think,
        that acknowledging and embracing your shadow is already your cup runneth over. In reality, admitting to being a
        son of a bitch doesn't mean you stop being one. You need to acknowledge your evil while improving it. It's
        impossible to get rid of the shadow fully, but chances are there is a lot of space for improvement, for example,
        an arrogant shadow can be countered with enough humility. </p>

    <p><em>“Yet, I was too proud and got punished for it. At least, I'm honest about it. Now, that I was honest, you may
            start to love me? Now I've improved and become an even better person in the sense that is obvious, yet
            invisible to most - because it's wrong: honesty isn't enough if no improvement follows it. After, all, you
            need to know your weaknesses better than your strengths.”</em></p>



    <p><strong><em>A walking contradiction.</em></strong> Not knowing your shadow well enough results in a walking
        contradiction, where you claim to deny one thing while secretly craving it. For example, in my case, that's
        hating and Christianity simultaneously. In the presence of enough pressure, you will break at your weakest
        point. Some people are more susceptible to drinking, others are more susceptible to depression. (That's the true
        reason for most mental health problems: in the presence of too much chaos, some people's psyche breaks.) Why do
        you think I'm mentioning promiscuity or materialism often? Sure, those things are objectively evil, yet, those
        cravings will need to be fought against at all times. Just because you are poor, incompetent, or unattractive
        doesn't mean that you are better than the dictator. If someone insisted that you need to become the new tyrant,
        or if an entire nation insisted on you becoming a tyrant, it would be impossible to resist, if you don't know
        your dark side. </p>

    <p><em>“And you don't want to live a life of regret, so you better act morally at all times. I'm a hypocrite, a
            walking contradiction, claiming that people simply find it impossible to understand me, because no one knows
            me, not even myself.”</em></p>

    <p><strong><em>The moralizer.</em></strong> There is a message in the text, which spans across the entire text and
        it's a critique of myself, where I question everything. For example, I acknowledge my limited perspective by
        saying for example: “Oh, every atheist is stupid.” But I have also thought about the trait of moralizing
        everything constantly. Sure, someone in person may find that trait annoying but having thought about it, I must
        come to the conclusion that this is a rather interesting situation, showing some contradiction. Reminding people
        of their immorality implies improvement, which is the equivalent of elevating yourself, which is highly immoral,
        of course, you are going to moralize only the areas where you have mastered it. My specific moral is shallow,
        its only areas are related to productivity. So, I simply don't know, but I do know that excessive moralization
        does no good and neither does a lack thereof. However, one must get explicitly moral in the face of a decision.
        For example, I'm not a hippie, but rather the exact opposite, but before this degenerate capitalist nonsense
        that is “black” Friday, I advised my parents not to buy any crap, there is nothing moral about consumerism. The
        text on social media already explained the essence of consumerism in greater detail. It enslaves you and makes
        you work for things you don't need; it makes you mistake products for happiness, and it destroys the planet. So,
        sure, consider morality in the face of a decision. But from an outside perspective, there is something I'm
        entirely unable to see. I'm moral, but only in the areas I care about myself, just as I'm disciplined but only
        when it comes to my work. However, I know that one must be moral at all times, otherwise one isn't moral at all.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>I know how to use the dark side.</em></strong> It's super interesting and well-known: women
        perceive the dark side of men often as attractive, subconsciously - yet often explicitly in the realm of
        thoughts. I'm cut off from the world of easy media, cheap books, and entertainment, yet I know that women often
        enjoy the archetypical story of a vampire, werewolf, pirate, doctor, or billionaire. Actually, that's one of the
        reasons why I developed a deep dislike for so-called “literature,” most of it is rubbish. To some extent this
        fantasy makes sense, (why would you want to fantasize about a loser?) but it can still be traced back to the
        dark side, the dark side is dangerous and this danger is tried to be tamed to compensate for her dark side which
        supposedly doesn't exist. I once reflected on my blog, because my dark side is often present in my texts. </p>

    <p>Notes from 8.8.2023 (a modified text draft, back then I didn't write that well):<br><em>“Why not, how
            provocative, confusing, controversial, insightful, new, meaningful, aggressive, or authentic does a text and
            its first
            sentence need to be to be of value and be outstanding? As I started to write I did not care about any of
            these things, I only cared about authenticity and value, because in my opinion, inauthentic, shallow,
            incomplete,
            fabricated texts are not worth anyone's time. Yet, I still felt constrained, especially in the beginning,
            because I didn't dare to show full authenticity - I lacked the skills and maturity to express myself free of
            constraints. The pure clean, shining white side would misrepresent everything, that's like the white yang
            without the black yin. But there is a decision, that everyone has to take and that is the trade between
            authenticity and trying to please as many people as possible. Because, when someone, like a YouTuber, gets
            big, they often lose their authenticity and their content becomes mediocre, because they are trying to
            please as
            many people as possible. Yet, authenticity also catalyzes growth in the first place. People are attracted to
            what
            is dark and real. There is a very thin line between these 2, between value and niceness, the desire to make
            text uncontroversial, unaggressive, and without any real thoughts. Another trade that everyone writing
            personal
            texts needs to make is how much to reveal about themselves. If you reveal too much, it has the same effect
            as if
            you reveal nothing about yourself - like a Gaussian or as some people call it “bell curve.” In both cases,
            people won't care anymore. I know quite well about the effects and dangers of falling for authentic writings
            because they can do the same damage as a romantic movie or book, just more intensely because they are real -
            they
            too one-sided build trust. To put it in other words; I know nothing about you. But a movie is different
            because
            everyone knows it's fake and that's why paranoid schizophrenia is scarier than any horror movie - you can't
            turn it off, ever. As of today, I can be sure that my future wife isn't reading these texts because they
            were
            kept a secret until the day before yesterday when I set this link as my WhatsApp info.”</em></p>

    <p>Get to know your dark side, otherwise, it will dictate your life in greater potency.</p>

    <h1>Hostile -isms</h1>

    <p>It was Friday, the 17th of November, an evening and I thought I was going to get a more nuanced view of the book
        I'd recently begun to read, “Notes from the Underground” (1864) by Dostoyevsky. I've interpreted this book as an
        example of how to live a messed-up life, and how to maximize misery. It starts directly like this.</p>

    <p><em>“I am a sick man ... I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased. However,
            I know nothing at all about my disease, and do not know for certain what ails me. I don't consult a doctor
            for it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine and doctors. Besides, I am extremely
            superstitious, sufficiently so to respect medicine, anyway (I am well-educated enough not to be
            superstitious, but I am superstitious). No, I refuse to consult a doctor from spite. That you probably will
            not understand. Well, I understand it, though. Of course, I can't explain who it is precisely that I am
            mortifying in this case by my spite: I am perfectly well aware that I cannot ‘pay out' the doctors by not
            consulting them; I know better than anyone that by all this I am only injuring myself and no one else. But
            still, if I don't consult a doctor it is from spite. My liver is bad, well—let it get worse!”</em></p>

    <p>The protagonist is 40 and after having inherited 6000 rubles, he quit his office job. He lost respect for himself
        a long time ago. The protagonist maximizes his misery by thinking instead of acting, he thinks of revenge and
        duels, yet never executes. He is trying to make the lives of people actively worse, being lazy, being
        irresponsible and blaming others, refusing challenge and change, being overly intellectual, being isolated, and
        lacking purpose. He tried to get revenge on an officer who didn't even know that he insulted the protagonist. He
        wants 2+2 to be 5 and wants the world to end, if he will still have his tea. He is a nihilist (and 40!) Then, I
        watched an analysis of the book and it said that the book matches precisely the critique of paradise and utopia.
        That's because people are going to try to destroy the world to prove their point. That's the essence of human
        nature from a pessimistic point of view. Yet, the positive sides of human nature are not more rational.</p>


    <p><em>“If everyone acted morally, or according to some -isms, we would live in paradise. What makes you think that
            paradise is great? Won't people try to kill paradise simply to prove their point and to escape indifference,
            by
            giving them a fake desire to follow after every authentic one was fulfilled or suppressed?”</em></p>

    <p>I was curious and watched an interpretation of another book, “Crime and Punishment” and I felt confirmed because
        the purpose of this book was to throw utilitarianism, socialism, atheism, nihilism, and every other -ism into
        the trash can. Here is a summary of the book “Crime and Punishment” The protagonist, and his mother are poor,
        hence they have to pawn their valuables to an old lady pawnbroker, who at the same time abused many people in
        poverty. The protagonist needs money because he wants to study law, but he is running out of it. So, no one
        likes that pawnbroker, and her death would be an obvious net positive for the world and for his family. And so,
        he kills that lady with an axe in the first chapter, and then the rest of the book is a conflict - rationally,
        he tried to justify his actions, yet what he didn't see was that acting immorally couldn't be removed by
        rationality. Eventually, he confessed and felt relief. </p>

    <p><em>“Before using arguments from authority or justification, just look at yourself in the mirror and accept your
            guilt by trying to justify things rationally. After all, if it's rational, how can it be wrong, if you are
            smart, how can it be wrong? Many -isms seem rational and correct, yet they are illusions in the presence of
            reality.”</em></p>

    <p>I wrote my text originally to express my dislike for the justification of some actions by using some rational
        series of argumentation like utilitarianism or feminism because many favor it over common sense. Sure,
        utilitarianism is bulletproof from a rational perspective, but not in the presence of reality and the irrational
        nature of humans. Rationality is often too cruel. Many texts of mine express the importance of staring at the
        white ceiling to distinguish between authenticity and inauthenticity, and the same applies to morality. If
        something seems to be morally correct because some ideology says so, that's inauthentic behavior. Inauthentic
        behavior always leads to mental suffering. Do you think abortion or assisted suicide is going to make you
        happier because it can be justified rationally, with the help of ideology and philosophy? </p>

    <p><em>“Some unspeakable acts may be justified with rational -ism, yet your heart will know the truth, any -ism is
            in its essence deeply misaligned with human nature.”</em></p>

    <p>There are other hostile -isms that I have tried to fight in past texts, for example, nihilism, existentialism,
        atheism, or absurdism. They all doubt the meaning of life or deny the meaning altogether. They feel enlightened
        as a result of their “knowledge”, which is the same thing as the protagonist of “Notes from the Underground,”
        who succumbs to Western ideology and feels what harm it does. When someone tells me, that life is meaningless, I
        would slap them in the face if I had little morals. That's why morals are important, and one must accept that
        one could be wrong. Frequently, I'm wrong. Have you ever considered nihilism to be a symptom of poor mental health or a lack of
        purpose, for example? Perhaps you are sitting in your room and thinking too much instead of going for walks.
        Grow up! Philosophy is the love (philo) for truth (sophia), yet sometimes this love gets too detached from
        reality too drastically - it becomes ignorance, which nihilists mistake for the genuine truth. There is a book,
        a very famous and controversial one. It's called “Better to never have been,” which is specifically against
        having children, a branch of nihilism called antinatalism. (Again, some weird -ism) The book argues that
        suffering outweighs joy and if more people exist, suffering gets magnified. But this book seems for lack of a
        better word, nonsense. Normally, you would have a question and try to answer it by approaching the truth, but in
        this case, they are justifying something they believe to be true. </p>

    <p>Probably no one ever taught you how to think a thought. Most likely you are living in the illusion that you need
        to fight an idea by making it sound silly, but that's arrogant and close-minded. In reality, thinking works by
        making the opposing side as strong as possible, because then you'll be able to compare. There is no point in
        digging your old beliefs deeper. </p>


    <p><em>“Some like the essence of childhood and teenage innocence, yet I live without illusions since I get slapped
            by reality frequently. But, I'm an adult, as I know that the maxim “If we can't explain something, it simply
            means, that we know too little” is a wrong assumption, while the questioning of the obvious always leads to
            great breakthroughs.”</em></p>

    <p>Atheism is one of the worst -isms, as it's highly immoral, inauthentic, and immature. You must not forget the
        essence of atheism, atheism denies God. Rationally, emotionally, spiritually, and morally you gain zero by doing
        so - instead, you lose a lot. If you like rationality so much, why don't you accept that trying to disprove
        God's existence leads to nowhere?<br>
        I'm not saying that believing in God is enough, it has to be strong and sincere faith, because otherwise immoral
        behavior will be impossible to resist. “Well, you've made no mistake, since there is no Christ and no one saw
        it.” Atheism is dangerous, a red flag, because if God isn't watching, who will prevent you from harming me? If
        you think to be the highest, the source of moral spirit, you are dangerous, in a purely negative sense.
    </p>

    <p>Let's suppose you land on some island after your ship sinks. You will be weakened and sick, unable to survive
        without help. You better pray that the inhabitants have proper moral and religious values. Otherwise, what's
        stopping them from killing you, after all, you are alone and helpless, an easy target. Luckily, surprisingly few
        people are atheists, most of them just don't actively believe in God. Religion is vital to provide a moral
        foundation, it has proven to be effective over the last millennia. </p>

    <p><em>“I think to find ideas on my own as I can't find their origin, do they come from staring at the ceiling?
            Probably not. If that was correct, why can't a person dying of dementia be creative, how am I able to be
            creative seemingly without any references? Oh, every atheist is stupid, I know better because my vision
            doesn't lead to the “paradise of rational thought”, I'm an orthodox Christian. Well, I must know better,
            because I'm smart and everyone thinking differently simply has no clue about how life works, yet I at 16
            years of age know better, after all, I have acted against everyone's will often and looked into the mirror,
            knowing that I was correct.”</em></p>

    <p>Hedonism. Consumerism. Narcissism. The search for hostile -isms can go on forever…</p>

    <p>The psyche isn't designed to think about the consequences of an event too much, because decisions are at the
        beginning and results at the end. Motivation comes a priori, before the event. Acting purely for the ends
        ignores the means. Yet, aren't you supposed to treat people as an end rather than a means? </p>

    <p>Common sense and good sense are necessary to determine if something is moral or not, not some -ism. Look in the
        mirror to find the truth. You don't need to know any specific philosophy to live a moral life, your heart
        already knows the answer. You may think that this text teaches nothing about moral behavior itself, but that's
        not true. If you know yourself, think for yourself, and act according to your heart, you are already morally
        ahead of almost everyone.</p>

    <p>Do you know which philosophy wants you to act true to yourself and stay moral at all times? Stoicism. That's the
        one of the only -ism that isn't hostile. </p>

    <h1>Consciousness</h1>

    <p><em>“{3:7} And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they [were] naked;” </em></p>

    <p>Consciousness gives the ability to distinguish between right and wrong. It doesn't make it happier on its own,
        because it allows existential suffering to exist. But more consciousness allows for greater morality, it is the
        foundation for it. Animals can't act morally, because they aren't conscious. </p>

    <p><em>“I'm conscious. [...] Yet, I think to know myself, since I'm conscious and see things as they are, not as
            someone wants me to see something. Consciousness, isn't that the key to happiness? I conditioned myself to
            be conscious at all times yet got happier by zero percent.”</em></p>

    <p>Consciousness allows the existence of voluntary suffering and sacrifice, as seen multiple times throughout the
        text. Frequently, the individual has to keep making sacrifices for morality to exist. A lack of consciousness
        results in artificial and much worse suffering. I have written multiple texts on consciousness,
        <a href="blog_70.html">#70</a>,
        <a href="blog_70.html">#71</a>,
        <a href="blog_70.html">#77</a>,
        <a href="blog_70.html">#55</a>,
        and <a href="blog_70.html">#44</a>. Text #70 is especially interesting because it matches the theme of
        destroying paradise to create
        meaning and to bring your mind into the presence, which it craves. Hence, you will hear distant calls at all
        times, trying to wake you up.
    </p>

    <p><em>“My knees are in pain and so are my eyes, I tried to sleep yet got woken up by distant calls. ‘You need to
            wake up' and I was sweating, refusing to answer those words directed to me, instead, I was startled every
            time I was called.”</em></p>

    <h1>The divinity of morality</h1>


    <p>You must become a monster, a dangerous person, a brutally competent one and then you need to learn how to use
        that for good. Being weak is fundamentally amoral. Simpletons, monkeys so to speak don't need morality, they
        think they are better than that. A weak person who gets a leaver to exert power does the unthinkable, because
        that person never learned how to handle it, weakness is hiding deeply immoral behavior. Only the person, that
        becomes strong and resists immorality can be called a legend. Do I need to provide examples, or is it apparent
        what constitutes a life without the guiding presence of moral considerations? </p>

    <p>Can one endure a life of immorality, fully aware of its inherent wrongness? The belief in the non-existence of
        God may lead one to dismiss the necessity of moral values, relying solely on rationality. The desire to navigate
        the game of life and emerge victorious may lead to a pragmatic and egoistic belief system. Do you think that
        such a short-sighted pragmatic egoistic narcissist can find happiness? A life devoid of moral principles
        descends into nihilism, resulting in misery. Such a life may appear to require no moral compass, but one should
        not forget the stark reality of existence without strong moral foundations. </p>

    <p>Morality becomes imperative in moments of danger when confronted with power or liminality. It is in these exact
        moments that reality unveils the true nature of individuals—distinguishing between those genuinely moral and
        those who feign morality when it suits their interests. <strong><em>However, never have I encountered a
                situation where I was forced to lie.</em></strong> </p>

    <p>Before and shortly after death, you are going to reflect on your life. There is no mistake - after death, your
        life continues. Every temporary nonsense is going to fade and you must want to have lived right, otherwise, you
        will be unable to come to peace. Also, once reflecting on the essence of life, you will come to realize, that
        there is more to life than morality. Yes, there is more to reality than morality. But you will be happy having
        acted morally - you won't be allowed to sell your soul.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Everything comes at a price.</em></strong><em>A servant once asked his kind what it felt like to be a
            king and so they switched
            roles for a week. The servant got excited to sit on the throne and to lead the country, yet was mostly
            concerned
            about the pleasures. He looked up and saw, that the king tied a sword right above the throne, where the
            servant
            would sit. The sword hung on a single hair.</em></p>

    <p>Let me reveal a perfectly moral trait - discipline.</p>

    <p>Consciousness allows us to navigate the complex landscape of right and wrong, the voluntary sacrifices made for
        moral principles highlight a divine aspect inherent in our choices. In acknowledging the dark side, the shadow,
        within ourselves, we open the door to a moral realm that demands continuous improvement. It is this recognition
        of our capacity for both good and ill that elevates morality to a level beyond the ordinary. Various -isms
        underscore the inauthenticity of ideologies that may seem rational but ultimately conflict with the essence of
        human nature. Hence, religious values are not only vital for individual guidance but are also foundational for
        societal harmony. Thus, the divinity of morality lies not just in its ethical principles but in the continuous,
        conscious effort to live a life aligned with moral truths, transcending the limitations of mere rationality or
        ideological constructs. </p>

    <p>You are already in ownership of precise knowledge of the people who forgot the core of morality and what it was
        created for in the first place - to live right. Hence, being smart is useless if you forget the essence of
        morality and abuse it. Shouldn't you follow the rules built and evolved over millennia, that passed the ultimate
        test of time? Be the change you wish to see and live as an example, like the saint person who becomes legendary.
        Morality is strength.</p>


    <h1>Conclusion, A life lived right.</h1>

    <p>There is a philosophy, which teaches how to live excellently. It's called stoicism. Stoics are present and
        mindful; they don't care too much about things outside their sphere of influence. Stoics are authentic - while
        accepting things they can't control. They believe that living right in virtue is the only way to live. Stoics
        are inherently rational, yet they know to not over or abuse it because virtue is more important than
        rationality. </p>

    <p>I want to provide an utterly different perspective on how to live a meaningful life. Don't try to seek pleasure
        and don't chase things, those things don't bring happiness anyway. Instead view your life as a constant test,
        one of countless moral dilemmas, tests, and decisions, waiting to be made, every year, day, and minute. That's
        the essence of life. </p>
