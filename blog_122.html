    <h1>How to be a good girl and why</h1>

    <p><em>To my female audience. You may not like it, but this is necessary. Long you may have hesitated to read
            because of what it may reveal. It's scary to be wrong in what one believes to be true. But you know what's
            right and what isn't deep in your heart…</em></p>

    <p><strong><em>Childhood innocence.</em></strong> When authors write their last book, … Do you think they write
        about saving the world and being a utilitarian murderer seeking to kill a baby to save a hundred lives, do you
        think they write about overthrowing the bourgeoisie and starting society anew, do you think they propagate that
        life is meaningless and that God doesn't exist? If you knew that you would only have the time to write one book,
        you wouldn't care about utilitarianism, I promise - at least if you matured and haven't lived as a mindless
        denying spirit and lived life seriously. Instead, you would look back on your life, on the time when it was
        simple and free of deep despair that comes from knowing things. You will be reminiscent of the days before you
        knew any concepts and ideas, there used to be a time when you had no idea or intent to know anything about the
        deep despair of life. You will realize that some things are better never to have been put into motion and never
        to be heard of. You will realize how you are 'smart', yet still unable to change the world. Life was meek before
        concepts, ideas, and knowledge corrupted it. Life was simple two hundred years ago when you lived in a village
        and there was no more than the farm, the church, your house, and your family, but then came concepts in
        abundance, and the world got complicated. When you're a child, the world looks differently than when you're an
        adult - growing up is losing the ability to unsee things and to sleep in peace. - This text could cause much
        detrimental pain while being full of contradictions. You of course could deny what you will read, but unseeing
        will remain impossible. That's growing up. But you of course could choose to stay a child, but I know you won't
        - I know that there is something deeper that wants to get out, there is a force inside of you that craves
        darkness. </p>

    <p><em>The less you know, the better you sleep. - Russian proverb.</em></p>

    <h1>1. The alpha you secretly dream of</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Wet dream.</em></strong> When you are about to go to bed, and completely alone, what do you think
        about? When you touch yourself, who are you dreaming of? Try to deny, try to resist, or try to reflect. What is
        it that you want of life and out of men? You may be tempted to say that you don't dream of anyone and never get
        lustful thoughts - which is complete nonsense. Look at the books on your bookshelf, visit your female friends,
        go to the cinema, or turn on the television. And now ask yourself whether it contradicts the perceptions you
        want others to have. When you reflect and realize that you are a true monster with a dark side large enough to
        be the most sadistic person one can imagine. I bet that your dreams are as dark as they get and you obfuscate
        because you want to look feminine, sweet, and innocent. You don't even have to look far or think deeply to
        notice how dark you can get. You are probably interested in fantasy, where there are worlds of monsters and
        darkness, you lust over vampires, werewolves, and rebels living in a grey, violent, and oppressive dystopia, and
        you find the thought amusing of pirates who kill and conquer and live their lives in freedom all coupled with
        romance where the hypercompetent male meets you and you try to tame him from there on. You enjoy seeing the
        shadow and you find joy in the fantasy of taming this force and strength. Almost as if you want the vampire to
        become good or degenerate yourself to become one as well. You dream of the man who is the pure embodiment of
        strength and success, with a shadow large enough to dim the entire book. You like to read in the middle of the
        night when you are alone. You like the fantasy when you look out of the window that there could be a vampire for
        you. You take a deep breath and your eyes widen, you almost start to hope. You are happy that you are alone, you
        don't want anyone to see who you are deep in your core. You want to be seduced by the pure embodiment of danger
        and then you dream of breaking him. </p>

    <p><strong><em>The story of “The Beauty and the Beast” by Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve.</em></strong> To dive
        deep into what constitutes female attraction, let's look at this fairy tale. You are pretty to the point where
        your sisters envy you, your father is rich, and your two older sisters party all day long and are entitled.
        You're the young, innocent, good, and meek one, you like to read and to improve yourself by reading and your
        dumb sisters don't understand you. Your father, a merchant, loses his wealth and all your family has left is a
        little cottage, suddenly you have to work. Your arrogant sisters earn no pity, but you as the humble and decent
        daughter are admired. You start to work hard and are the embodiment of a good girl. You get up at 4 (read
        yourself) in the morning to cook breakfast and to help in the household. Your sisters, these losers, get up at
        10 and complain all day long about how much it sucks to be broke and insult you for your patience. Surprisingly
        it turns out that your father got lucky, as it turns out, his ships didn't sink. Your sisters demand jewelry and
        when your father asks you what you want, you tell him that you don't want anything, except a rose from your
        garden. The father travels to the port and it turns out, he got scammed at the port and returns just as broke as
        he was. On the way back the father enters a dense forest and gets lost, it's a cold, rainy night. He spots light
        on the horizon and goes there, it's an empty palace with an abundance of food, he eats and warms himself as the
        palace remains empty. Your father leaves the palace after on the next morning and wants to get some roses in the
        garden of the palace for you, the beauty. The beast emerges, he wants to kill your father for the roses he tried
        to get for you. The beast is ruthless and cold but agrees to make an offer. Your father must die now or in three
        months, if you as the beauty refuse to go to the beast and die there as a substitute. As the father returns
        home, you offer your father to sacrifice yourself to the beast, although your father wanted to propagate to your
        other sisters that they would go to a palace. After the promised three months, you arrive at the palace of the
        beast and have a feast. The beast asks whether you came willingly and as you tell him yes with your nervous
        voice, he tells you that you're a good girl. The monster tells your father to never come back, i.e. you are no
        longer under the ownership of the father but of the beast. The next day you go around the place and find a
        paradise, a massive library, music, and a room in gold for you. You realize in this moment that you want to see
        your poor father, but you are still intimidated by the beast. The beast asks you if you want to marry him. The
        book says you respond 'with an answer which implies non-consent' and the beast cries! You broke the beast and
        became the alpha yourself; you tell the beast that you admire him but don't love him. You tell the beast that
        you want to see your father otherwise you'll become depressed. The beast tells you to promise to return in a
        week to his place, and the next morning you wake up at your father's house with more treasure. The beast thinks
        that you forgot your promise and wants to kill himself. “Oh, no my best you shall not die - become my husband” -
        In this moment, the beast becomes a handsome price. You broke the prince's spell and transformed him from a
        beast to a prince and you become a queen. As it turns out, this was just a test by a fairy to see if you had a
        pure heart and passed the test. The fairy is also a pragmatist, she tells you that your sisters became statues
        until they express remorse, hence, they going to stay statues forever. </p>

    <p><em>My wife and I are going to read it to our children with different eyes.</em> I have to admit that I never
        read any fairy tales consciously and now I realize how sophisticated, deep, and true they can be. A submissive
        woman, a good girl, who breaks men is a common archetype and it happens in real life. To understand what I'm
        referring to, read my text post #87, so from October 2023. That's why I think we don't have to interpret the
        summary of the Beaty and the Beast. The words used by the beauty sounded exactly like the girl that broke me as
        a non-metaphoric monster with her rejection to set me straight and to have the pleasure of knowing what the
        fairy tale shows. There is a lot of spiritual knowledge in fairy tales, children get the moral in them and you
        know what they are about in their essence. What you may not know is that “The Beaty and the Beast” was written
        by Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve in 1740, she like any author wrote to process their thoughts, wishes, and
        fantasies. On the shallow side “The Beaty and the Beast” is about humility and not judging on looks, on the
        deeper side about female behaviors and fantasies. You as the meekest character end up dominating the darkest
        monster. </p>

    <p><em>The same everywhere.</em> Other girls who don't usually read enjoy these fantasies and watch movies instead.
        They will watch a story where things are dark and frightening, vampires are popular. Girls who don't enjoy this
        vampire stuff anymore instead watch what seems to me as a 16-year-old man is mindless nonsense, made to be
        watched while on a phone. In some stories, there is a poor and soft girl who gets into a romance story with the
        mafia boss. It works perfectly, every plot is predictable. One example of many, I remember once watching a movie
        with my mother. It's a Russian movie and it is set in the 90s when Russia was in chaos (darkness). There was a
        hospital chef (alpha male) who wasted the funds (shadow) to finance himself a mansion (palace) and wanted to
        gift it to a woman, the woman refused as this wasn't virtuous in her eyes. How the movie plays out, I don't know
        and don't care and it doesn't matter. I assume you can't be that complicated if every fantasy looks the same. I
        have never met a girl or woman who doesn't regularly indulge in their fantasy. No matter how ugly or pretty,
        rich or poor, dumb or sophisticated, feminist or religious - they all do it. In their fantasy, they all want the
        alpha who they want to tame. All girls have a celebrity crush, meaning they all desire the alpha so to speak. It
        may surprise you, but men don't care about palaces, monsters, vampires, fantasy, romance, or dystopias… from a
        male perspective, it's all nonsense. Most men don't watch anything outside of documentaries or films once in a
        while if they want to delude themselves into thinking they are productive and having fun. Or they watch
        something with their girlfriend because of that which comes after the movie. Common men read instructions on how
        to build the furniture, not some intriguing fantasy. Most men, don't also don't read out their fantasies, they
        watch them as it's more straightforward. No wonder most women are regarded as smarter than most men. But then
        some men are superior to you in any regard and those men that are magnitudes smarter and more dangerous than
        women -will be broken at the softest girl… However, men don't indulge in their shadow as much as women do, as
        most are too weak to have one, i.e. they repress it and numb themselves. The alpha males incorporate it, and
        they become the competent monster. If you are wondering what the superior man reads or watches, it's almost
        exclusively literature that tells him he is dumb, weak, and evil, to make him clean his soul, commonly known as
        catharsis. That too gives much deeper meaning to my slogan, don't go to the cinema, it doesn't make a superior
        person. </p>

    <p><em>At this point, I don't know which hole I dug myself in.</em> At this point, I don't know which hole I dug
        myself in. I know that women want the alpha, but I also know that women want to dominate, or to better phrase
        it, tame the alpha while being feminine… I guess women are complicated without ends. Women want a leader, and
        somehow, they crave to control the leader. I don't understand how I, who views himself as an alpha is supposed
        to handle women - if they end up dominating every monster, sorry, what kind of nonsense is that? I can't
        comprehend this contradiction. Am I destined to be a leader while being led by my wife while I'm at home or
        what? Does the king get beaten by his queen…? I dare you to try to dominate me - the harder you push the more
        I'll resist - so maybe the softest way is the most effective to oppress! </p>

    <p>The text will only go <em>deeper</em> from here, I know that women enjoy depth in all of the word's meanings.</p>

    <h1>2. Resisting hedonism - Thinking long term</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Do you want the alpha?</em></strong> Well over 2000 words later and now may I reveal what the deep
        essence of the many paragraphs above was. I wanted to point out a slight hypocrisy… If you wonder what goes
        through my head when I'm not thinking about the essence of life, what I'm grateful for, why utilitarianism must
        be wrong, why atheism is a heresy or hot girls, I'm going through texts I will write or have written. My
        thoughts sound exactly as sorted and clean as my writing, that's why I think on paper and don't have a voice in
        my head, which, by the way, is the equivalent of spiritual enlightenment. When I think of my texts, I always ask
        myself certain questions. For example, where am I going and where do I want to go, what would I do in
        retrospect, how do I get rich, where am I lying to myself… And asking questions like these has engrained my
        subconscious. - Yet, do you realize how inauthentic it is when you dream of the alpha when you touch yourself
        and then look at your reality? The average man is nothing like the alpha you dream of.</p>

    <p><em>“I saw. I came. I crumbled the kitchen to the annoyance of my wife.”</em> - The motto of the mediocre man.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>The average man is a curse. </strong> That's a quote my mother conceived. Have you ever been to a
            beach and seen any 40-year-old with a six-pack, who isn't a disintegrated fat loser? I haven't seen that
            often. The average man is obese. Do you want a man who leaves shit stains when he goes to the toilet? The
            average man watches something approximately 2 hours of pornography a week, even if they are married and not
            too few are too incompetent to hide it. The average man has a car that has trash lying on the back seats if
            he didn't extra clean it, and his car stinks as if he never cleaned it. If you want to have your first time
            in a car, how do you like having trash, empty stinking crumpled-up bottles, plastic bags, and moist brown
            apple cores lying next to you and your 'love' having a stinking breath? The average man comes home from work
            and lies down for 4 hours straight while you will have to somehow handle the undisciplined children who lack
            the alpha they need for their healthy development. Your children are effectively fatherless. Without a
            strong male voice, they will stay boys and never become men, they will stay weak, unable to handle life. He
            is not only fat but also weak, and can't run faster than a 12-year-old boy. His smell is going to resemble
            that of a woman if tested by a machine as he will have as much testosterone as you. Do you want someone who
            has so little discipline he can't resist social media or video games? Is someone too stupid to control where
            he puts his hands and what he shovels in his mouth? He will lie around and take shallow breaths while
            sitting with a posture like someone who has been beaten almost to death. Do you want a man who drives his
            car and doesn't even look if there is someone on the street who is criminally reckless? Nothing is ever his
            fault, but that of everyone else, and that life can't be all about work. When you try to save the
            relationship by pointing out his flaws, he will say that he has enough and that you're the one who is
            turning insane. “On the weekend I'm going to buy myself a new television and spend a lot of money on it so
            that I can get the full potential of my gaming console.” Do you want a man who is so weak he won't be able
            to resist any cancerous sweets and buy himself some chips because the cake you made him with love wasn't
            sweet enough? He will go to the store if you beat him and command him to, but when he comes back, you're
            going to starve for a week as he only bought sub-human food. The average man, when you look him in the eyes,
            you will see that he is a full-on idiot, mentally as dull as a zombie, lacking any depth or character.
            Instead, he will lie on the sofa with a curvy back and fart and won't help but see the fat he amassed and
            the shell of a man he has become. At least he is balanced. At least you get a bit of fun by dominating him
            once in a while. The only conversations will be about your chores in the household which he refuses to do
            effectively. He may have a well-paying job and a pretty house, but you won't be able to ignore that he is
            brutally incompetent outside of that. The high salary won't be able to hide that he is not the alpha you
            dreamt of. Forgetful, clumsy, awkward, passive, apathetic, and submissive a child so to speak, a beta. You
            are the one who has to make the phone calls. You will think to yourself, at least I'm not the cat lady and
            have someone, and at least he has a warm heart and he may be a loser but I still love him. You will find
            ways to cope. You will have a laugh about your husbands with your female friends. But then, when you see him
            lying on the sofa again, you will remember that you had sex the last time he bought you flowers which was no
            less than 4 months ago. Generally, you will lose any attraction to each other and the love you will make
            will feel meaningless and dry, you will reach a point where you let him have sex with you just so that he
            feels a bit happy, you won't feel this intense attraction you would feel towards the alpha... He may be 'a
            bit fat', but he goes to football training. Isn't it nice for him to go to a shashlik with a beer in the
            summer evening? His thinking may be full of unproductive beliefs, but at least he embodies the conscious
            collective, he doesn't bother with deep conversations. He is not the crazy guy who aggressively asserts what
            is right and what is wrong. At least your little child isn't abusive or a full-on crackhead, alcoholic, or
            too resentful of life. This man at least got lucky with you, some men, the bottom 20% are too much of a
            loser to be in a relationship. You at least feel superior when you get to take out your resentment and feel
            bright if you spend time with him, you enjoy when he looks dumb in front of you, and you like the inner
            validation as much as Kafka enjoys describing torture methods. You don't leave him because you're not too
            attractive anymore either and because you accept or give up. You will take a deep breath and think that
            that's just life and that the monster you dreamt of when you were 14 just doesn't exist. Every man you see
            at the beach is fat, you will justify yourself. “I need to stop being so idealistic.” That's just life and
            that's normal, that's the way it's supposed to be. Call it normal because it's common. Now you have someone
            'just as imperfect as you' because of the mistakes you made. Welcome to the sweet life of quiet, helpless
            desperation. - That's the beta<br><br>
            I know my text contains a lot of black-and-white thinking, but I fear this description is not to be
            underestimated. Maybe, you will think that your beta has a bunch of bad habits, isn't successful, is slow,
            and is full of other negative traits, but in his deep core, he is a good person. Maybe, but just that
            doesn't make the winner evil.
        </em></p>

    <p><strong><em>The alpha.</em></strong> I think I need to qualify as to what constitutes an alpha; most people have
        a misconception inside of them that the alpha is simply the guy who has a lot of sex. But that's like saying
        that utilitarianism is about killing random people if it serves the collective good. With 'alpha' I simply refer
        to the guy on top, just as you would imagine, he is hot, rich, … and beyond that assertive, energetic,
        disciplined, trained, wise, religious, deep, romantic, caring … - everything that makes him irresistible. The
        most attractive one is also caring for his children. He is the practical inverse of the average man. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Listen to what I advise.</em></strong> If you're ugly and unable to attract an alpha, fair enough but
        there is more you can do than you think. If you dream of a beta and aren't unattractive, I recommend you to
        reassess everything from the moment you were born, that's going to be a later part of the text and that's going
        to be dark. Unless you want to be the depressed delirious lonely cat lady or be a part of the 95% of women who
        get a loser as their man, if you instead want a man who will make your life more meaningful, loving, and
        interesting, you better listen what I have to advice you! Learn the easy way or the hardest possible way, which
        is a life of regret. Learn from text, not from regret. Life is too short to figure out everything by pure reason
        and even shorter to figure things out empirically. Many things in this text will be discarded by you as you may
        not like them, but you want to avoid the situation where you knew something, denied it, and then 30 years later
        it turned out to be distractedly true. </p>

    <p><strong><em>There are more alphas than you think.</em></strong> When I used to use the internet, I used to think
        that all women are degenerated, unfaithful, and aggressively deluded feminists who are in reality nothing more
        than mindless hedonists, all using social media and hooking up. After one year of not wasting time on the
        internet, I still have some false beliefs, for example, I have a deep fear that I won't be able to find a
        virgin, which is statistically false. You may think equivalent things; there are no good men. That's false.
        Firstly, there are more alphas than you think there are. You may think that they only exist on paper or the
        internet but that's simply not correct. There are guys you would lust over everywhere; you're just not trained
        to find them or they are taken. Or maybe you are looking at the village club instead of the gym. You don't have
        to look far, who do you think I am, some pushover or what? My life, character, behavior, and values also
        constitute that of an alpha, I know bloody well where my life is heading - except that when I look at myself in
        the mirror, I get reminded that I'm not 24 but 16, and started to train only a year ago, I think, my crush knows
        she could have a chance of winning in arm wrestling. But don't look at me. I know a guy who's 18 and he looks
        like a Greek God with strong values. He has character and helped me a lot, he is the reason I started to become
        social in December 2022 and didn't just linger as an asocial kid who focuses just on his work. He prevented me
        from being the lonely loser at the age of 50, if I started to socialize in December 2023, I may have created a
        bunch of irreparable damage as I would be too old, 16. He is charismatic, not aggressive. He is not judgmental
        but listens. He for example is taken. Then, another alpha I know is short but still considered hot by most
        girls. He is also very charismatic and ambitious. He also trains hard and I can't imagine him to be too awkward
        to make calls. Another alpha I know is feared/admired/a friend of them both and I'm also a bit scared of him.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Is he real?</em></strong> I have to warn you. Some attractive guys are as evil as their female
        equivalent and are hedonists or manipulators, some both. Knowing a few hostile manipulators, I wrote multiple
        texts on that, #104 and #120. We will talk about that later. Contrastingly, it's pretty easy to identify if he
        is a hedonist if he slept with more than 3 girls in the past year, he wants to be a playboy and will take a
        virgin wife when he is 35 and stops being wild. Simply ask him, men are straightforward. You will also have to
        consider that the filter for men is only at the age of 25. Many boys are crackheads and still look great because
        they happen to be gifted genetically, but beyond the age of 25 their lifestyle haunts them - it compounds.
        That's sweet revenge. Likewise, some people can be considered unlucky. I don't want your pity, but I was ugly as
        a 14-year-old and had a bit of a life behind me which left me with deep scars. Thus, many things held me back,
        and many problems I created myself, so I'm unlucky in that sense. Except that it flips as soon as enough passes.
        You need to distinguish if he is pretty and goes to parties weekly or if he is ugly and does sports every day.
        The best indicator comes down to sitting upright. There are neural pathways to track one's status and posture is
        a reflection of whether one is a loser or a winner. This distinction is bipolar, i.e. black and white, either
        his brain tells him he is a loser or his brain tells him he is a winner. I haven't ever seen a counterexample.
        The 3 alphas I described always sit upright and every loser that looks pretty because he is young all sit like a
        question mark. The manipulators, if they are dumb, will also sit like question marks. I don't want to sound like
        Kafka, but most men sit as if they had been just beaten in the gulag and don't dare to express confidence,
        because they are so crumbling. Most likely it's their bad conscience thrashing them for living. I could write a
        whole essay as to why sitting upright is one of the best indicators of them being authentic gold. Sitting
        upright is a sign of dominance, also in the realm of animals. Since most people are mentally offline, sitting
        upright is subconsciously a reflection of how you view yourself and how others should perceive you. If one had a
        brutal workout, he wouldn't be scared to sit upright. It's the losers who tilt their head down instead of
        looking forward. Those don't look anyone in the eyes, as they are too scared to be perceived as a threat. They
        look away from life instead of looking forward as one could portray it metaphorically. </p>

    <p><strong><em>The path of the middle? </em></strong> Well, maybe the alpha is too much for you, you might think you
        don't want to live with a guy where you fear him getting another woman or can't handle the primal attraction you
        are going to feel. You might think that you don't want a guy whom you feel helplessly dumb in comparison who you
        will have to fear because of his harsh judgments and who will grip your hand faster than you can look if you
        grab sweets. You may think that you don't want a beast, even if you tame him. You may think to yourself that you
        want an average guy to live a peaceful and quiet life. Then you can feel superior perpetually, every time you
        see him lying on the sofa and eating chips. You may think that you want to live in a simple village house with
        him never doing anything remarkable or something that makes you lust over him, you may feel as if you want to
        have a normal family with a normal life. - Except you're your imagination is simply false. Trust me, you do not
        want the average modern man, I think you're interpreting the middle wrong and are deeply misled. Certainly, the
        dictator is an overkill so you need an alpha, not the alpha. Simple. Nonetheless, a lot of people may disagree
        and say that the average man is good enough and that's ignorant of the times we live in. Technology is always a
        multiplier. For most people the multiplier is 0.2x, i.e. they are 5 times below their potential, and for some,
        the multiplier is 1, for someone different the multiplier is 300. To advertise me, if over the last 250 days, I
        maintained an average word count of 1000 and had countless adventures on the side, it's an example of a let's
        say 5x multiplier. But I'm not the average person and if you compare me to the average person, you will not do
        yourself any good. You shouldn't forget how much men suffer from technology. For example, most men are unable to
        have erections because they spend too much time on the internet. They don't even have to shave as their pillow
        emits toxic phthalates without ends which makes them infertile. The average man, the path of the middle, was
        good enough when strength was the default when man used to have strong values and hand pressure as tight as my
        great-grandmothers. When you are living in 1950, you are either a winner or a loser, but you can't ignore if you
        were a loser, as there was no internet to entertain you, no video games to give you a feeling of being
        productive and being successful and no porn to make you feel loved, men from 1950 had to face who they were
        contrary to the modern man who lives in easy times. That's why, the actual middle has been corrupted and become
        shifted far to the higher percentages; 80%, 90%, 95%, and 99% are the percentages of where the updated middle
        lies. There are many statistics to prove this, 80% of women are perceived as attractive by men, and 20% of men
        are perceived as attractive by women, also strong values are gone since God is dead and we have killed him,
        beyond values there's only hedonism left, that's why it gets tighter towards the top, winner takes all once
        again. Furthermore, life has become too easy because of technology and that brings weakness, for most the
        multiplier is 0.4 across all of life's areas. Since technology is a multiplier, the 99.99%, one in 10.000, get a
        300x multiplier on every area of their life… If my life is 10x that of a normal person, their lives are 10x
        beyond mine… Tell me, where is the middle? You need someone with a multiplier of say 3-30x, which means, that
        the person is three times ahead of the rest, in terms of how they spend their time. 'In terms of how they spend
        their time' because I live right and time hasn't turned in my favor yet, hence, look at what they spend their
        time doing. I would find social media usage on the border acceptable, what loser is he going to become when he
        spends 30 minutes or 4 hours a day on social media for the next 10 years rather than read in that time,
        especially considering the strong negatives of social media? I promise he is going to be the fat loser who will
        buy you flowers once every 4 months. Don't forget that there are guys who don't touch their phones and live
        amazing lives and are the ones who addict the rest. That sounds a lot like a class struggle, most people get
        exploited for attention, and others exploited. Hence, the middle is now at the top. Ignore, pay, and the price.
        Don't mistake mediocrity for the golden middle. </p>

    <p><strong><em>I'm ugly, should I still be motivated by this text?</em></strong> First of all, I would like to punch
        you in the face for talking nonsense. 'I'm ugly' is not a real thing. I'm not trying to delude you, you may be
        an actual 3/10. Nevertheless, being ugly still isn't real just as depression isn't. If you don't see the sun,
        use a plastic cutting board, eat anything outside of meat, vegetables, or fruits, deprive yourself of sleep, and
        sit with a curvy back while wasting your time on social media, that's how you are going to look. How you look
        reflects how you live. Pretty girls and pretty men are sexy because beauty is an indicator of health. A
        symmetrical face is an indicator of a trauma-free childhood. If you are insecure that your ass didn't grow well,
        maybe you're sitting too much and doing too little sports. Men think that if they are short, they won't get a
        woman, which is the same kind of nonsense, you can be trained like a Greek God even if you are short. Stop
        telling yourself nonsense like 'I'm ugly'. If you fix your life, it's impossible to look ugly. If you should
        look ugly under those circumstances as well, there are many examples of a leader taking an ugly woman. If you're
        ugly and boring at the same time, that's another thing. But referring to ugliness, if you're a 3/10, doubtlessly
        you can transfer yourself to a 7/10 if you start to sit upright, see the sun, mediate, go to the gym, train your
        legs, eat healthy, go for a run every day, play some music instrument, never wear clothes that reveal your
        belly, never get tattoos, don't die your hair, don't wear lipstick or make your nails, read daily, avoid
        parties, don't talk to men, have attractive female friends… Just be a good girl. Let me put it this way. When
        will being a bad girl ever help you? Never. If you still think you are ugly, there is also a lot that can be
        changed by your hair, hair being an example. I know a girl who is a 5/10 if she ties her hair to the back and an
        8/10 if she makes her hair slightly curly and to the front. Another girl dropped her attractiveness from 5/10 to
        3/10 by dying her brown forehead blonde. Figure out what you can do. If you want makeup advice, don't use
        makeup, if you do want to increase your attractiveness, make your cheeks slightly red. If you use lipstick, make
        sure you don't look like a soviet grandmother who has seen some things, i.e. never use burgundy (dark red)
        lipstick. So better avoid makeup altogether, it makes you look inauthentic, which leans towards the problematic.
        If you have a crush on somebody, you blush, and because one is attracted to people attracted to one
        subconsciously, hence redly cheeks are an effective and subtle manipulation tactic you can use, especially if
        you are a blonde and have pale skin. Don't worry about your body, it just has to be trained and capable, you
        should at least be able to run 10km. You might also think that numbers like 3/10 are subjective, if they are,
        good. If rate someone as a 4/10, she may be a 7/10 in someone else's eyes - that's additional motivation for you
        to be a good girl. </p>

    <p><strong><em>I used to be promiscuous, should I still be motivated by this text to be a good girl?</em></strong>
        That's complex. Accept that you made your life a lot worse, don't lie to yourself. There will be no prince
        waiting for you, but anyway, that issue is so complex that it will be elaborated further, mostly between the
        lines. </p>

    <p><strong><em>To all the girls that could have been mine.</em></strong> You choose your environment by choosing how
        you present yourself on the first impression. If you used to be the party girl in school, everyone used to view
        you as such, but if you meet new people in a new environment, by going to university for example, you can stop
        presenting yourself as one and no one would think of you as the party girl. If you are the girl who is known to
        be mindless and always spending time with male losers, go to university and stop doing so, and use the
        university as an excuse to 'lose contact'. You've got this.</p>

    <p><strong><em>On the shortness of life.</em></strong> Now I'm in 12 grade and regular school ends in 2 weeks.
        Someone told me that life is long, but it isn't. You don't have much time. If you're 18 and you didn't find your
        high school sweetheart, you don't have much time left. When you meet a guy, you want at least one or two years
        to pass before you get a child. You can't afford many breakups, yet delaying necessary breakups only makes them
        worse. That means, if you haven't found your love by the age of 22, time is ticking even faster. I want to
        pressure you here, despite me knowing that women are under a lot of pressure already, children born to
        30-year-olds never develop as healthily as the ones born to younger parents, simply because you as a 22-year-old
        will have more energy and feminine energy and less pragmatism inside of you. At the age of 28-36, you will go
        through a family-career crisis and I hope you don't make the meaningless choice. Beyond the age of 36, you can
        forget children, and beyond the age of 40, you can forget a husband. It's over, now you're the cat lady and you
        don't want that state of existence. You technically could bear children at 36 but do you want to give birth to a
        potential retard and then raise him until you're 53, almost a pensionary? I don't think so. Some women don't
        want children to begin with, shame on them for ending your bloodline which is 3 700 000 000 years old, and for
        being immature. The most common response to this argument is that life is meaningless anyway, which isn't true,
        they are just living it wrong. </p>

    <p><em>Time against you.</em> The longer you wait, the less of an alpha the guy is going to be. Men want virgins,
        not the girl who partied for a decade until she became 26. Why should the attractive guy pick the 26-year-old
        who did the opposite of waiting for him when he can any woman? Of course, there are some examples where a king
        takes a promiscuous woman, but what kind of king is he then if he falls for the manipulation of a peasant? It
        may sound as if I'm advertising myself again, but I do believe that the best way to get the alpha is if he is
        not one but is heading this way, also since the alphas I described are all taken and those that are not, are
        playboys, which you must avoid. </p>

    <p><em>How many restaurants?</em> The current part of the text is called 'resisting hedonistic temptations' and they
        are the things that turn off every high-value man for example; parties, casual sex, ideology, drugs, tattoos,
        belly-revealing clothes, dying hair, makeup in excess, loser friends (especially male), social media, junk-food,
        … The thing about these pleasures is that they become boring and don't make much fun to begin with. If you lost
        your virginity drunk at a party, how will you feel waking up, knowing that you missed your chance of getting
        your dream guy and wrestling for the weeks to come in your mind whether you genuinely ruined your life? At least
        the attention felt nice. If you already ruined yourself, why not again? Less extreme example. You want to see
        the world, that's why you want to wait with children. - How many restaurants do you need to visit to realize how
        boring they are? How many parties do you need to go to realize nothing is interesting about them? </p>

    <p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">*****</p>

    <p><strong><em>Quick summary.</em></strong> You dream of the most competent men, but your reality may look
        different, especially if you are or were too weak to resist cheap pleasures. The average man is far away from
        that which you dreamt about, if not the inverse, but this could be the price you will have to pay if you find a
        man 'just as imperfect as you'. Then you may have some self-limiting or wrong beliefs, such as that you have
        time, you're ugly, you want someone average, or that there are no attractive guys. So, if there are attractive
        guys, you're attractive and life is short, is that enough motivation to resist hedonism? </p>

    <p><strong><em>Don't forget what the most important life decision is.</em></strong> Whether you work as a teacher or
        doctor doesn't change the fact that you're still a proletarian with a boring and sort-of meaningless life. With
        the right man, it gets determined whether you work for fun or out of desperation. Therefore, the impact is much
        more significant, it's more significant than any other decision you will make. What do you want to get out of
        life?</p>

    <h1>3. War over you</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Don't listen to the monkey part of your brain.</em></strong> This is too offensive to be said in
        person, so I'm writing it. If your brain is full of unproductive beliefs, stop listening to it. For example,
        some girls are deluding themselves into thinking that life is meaningless. When they start to view life as
        meaningless, that's how their life is going to materialize. Those people make me want to pursue martial arts, if
        they know that their beliefs make their lives worse, why don't they fix them? I know some women who have severe
        trust issues. They know that they have trust issues and if I ask why they don't fix them, they respond something
        along the lines of 'not everyone can throw their old beliefs over board, you may find it easy, others don't' I
        think to myself, what the hell? You can choose what to think and which thoughts to think and you can refuse to
        think a thought at will. Some women think that male friends who secretly want to have sex with them are
        acceptable because the monkey part of their brain enjoys validation. Some monkey-brained people are going to
        think that social media is the right way to spend their time and start to say that you learn something while
        looking at fake girls. The monkey brain tells you to eat sweets. The monkey brain tells you to go to a party.
        Why the hell would you listen to this part of your brain? A fat person will refuse to sacrifice food. An
        alcoholic will put drinking above everything else. A party girl will enjoy being a degenerate. Look where it
        leads to. Why do you think humans developed a sense of intuition to view what is right and what isn't? To fix
        the problems that came from being an unconscious being. </p>

    <p><strong><em>As a woman, you aren't capable of logic.</em></strong> Accept that or delude yourself into thinking
        that your false doctrine is correct. Some hardcore feminists may now begin to cry or to laugh, and if you are
        one, I would say you are even more deluded than the girl who thinks she is capable of logic. People with common
        sense, who read a feminist book or watch a feminist talk, notice that they argue the same way as a daughter, a
        wife, or a teenage girl, just with a lot more dissatisfaction. Even if you are a rather masculine girl, chances
        are, you still are highly emotional on the inside. The more they talk, the more universal my point seems to
        become. Not being capable of logic doesn't mean they're stupid unless you ask a feminist who thinks that logic
        is the only reality. Logic is brutal, cruel, and cold. “Well actually, I'm brutal, cruel, and cold, women are
        allowed to be so” - Do you identify with this statement? I doubt it. If so, what do you need a man for if you
        can get a punching bag instead to indulge in your assertiveness gained purely from resentment? You may think
        that you scored 174 on the IQ test and are gifted with logic, nevertheless, this is wide of the mark, an IQ test
        has nothing to do with living right and implementing the truth. It's illogical to be undisciplined and to have
        male friends, still you're likely doing it. Being on social media for 15 minutes or 4 hours a day is complete
        nonsense, that's why I simply don't do it, that's logic and solving some puzzle. “Well, what about Sofya
        Kovalevskaya or Ada Lovelace?” - But you are not a semi-legendary mathematician and almost certainly will become
        one. Don't forget who you are. I doubt that you even knew their names since you don't authentically care about
        math. Also, just because they did math all their life long, doesn't mean that they are desirous of spending
        their life this way and neither does it mean that they didn't have mood swings. Admitting that you're not very
        logical is a much more creative approach than trying to slaughter a true idea. To balance your lack of logic,
        you have other forces, such as intelligence of the emotions, heart, and intuition.</p>

    <p><strong><em>The world is trying to win you.</em></strong> Because you aren't able to think logically as much as
        it's necessary to survive alone, the entire world is fighting to influence, manipulate, indoctrinate, or push
        you. As a woman, you can't become an Übermensch who overthrows everything there ever was and starts from scratch
        to create a fundamentally new moral system. Most men are incapable of doing so, and you expect to do so with a
        loving heart? Perhaps you too fall for poisonous ideologies because you think they bring good to the world. I
        find it difficult to spot a girl who is not a nihilist-Marxist-feminist, radically religious,
        what-her-parents-think, or mentally offline - must be one of them. These philosophies all contradict each other,
        but there is simply no girl who can be radically religious if her parents are Marxist. The opposite can be true,
        there can be a man with Marxist parents who goes counter everything and becomes a monk. Men have to go counter
        everything all the time, they become rich despite their parents being broke as the typical example, in fact,
        this a defining trait that makes a man an alpha in the first place. You may think that the feminist girl who is
        predominantly masculine can resist her environment and this is false, if she grew up in a monastery, she would
        not be a feminist. Another perfect example, I'm strong and assertive, and my blog contradicts almost everyone in
        my environment in almost every aspect <em>passionately</em>. </p>

    <p>Your parents influence you, your male friends, your boyfriend, your female friends, school, society, the
        internet… Normally it's your father's duty to decide what is correct and later your husband's. I know that this
        is too idealistic since many grew up without a masculine father and find the idea that their husband decides
        what's right for them sounds absurd to many. Fatherless girls will certainly indoctrinate beliefs that do not
        serve you, for example, that male ownership is 'toxic masculinity'. Your male friends may tell you that control
        is evil while your future husband tells you to cut out their voices. If you lack an alpha father or a father in
        general, try to think to yourself what he would say. Do you think he would recommend you to go to a party after
        your breakup? Or would he rather hug you and you would feel his inner calmness, he will say that everything is
        alright. It's not easy to think for yourself, especially as a woman. </p>

    <p>Perhaps shouldn't listen to your parents too much. If they are living right, which manifests itself in success,
        if they are happily together, have sex daily, are rich, live in a pretty house, have peak health, … then, listen
        to them. </p>

    <p>The thing about male ownership and your man deciding what is right for you certainly can lead to abuse and may be
        useless if you as the woman end up being the alpha, but not so with a strong man, who you will feel attracted
        to, in which case this paragraph will become self-evident. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Modern feminism is an overkill.</em></strong> One false belief that I want to expose is the idea of
        feminism. I would say that my conception thereof exceeds that of the average man who knows everything about
        feminism from 15-second clips from the internet and thinks to be smart. Feminism makes sense in the idea that a
        husband shouldn't beat his wife and that women should be allowed to work and drive cars. But I also know that
        some want to argue even these ideas and I don't want this paragraph to be 10,000 words long, so here's the
        essence. If one says that one is allowed to wear clothes that reveal the belly, using feminism as a
        justification is nothing more than a reckless hedonist. If one thinks that one needs to change the roots of
        society, by manipulating the collective vocabulary, one is acting on one's shadow that likes to oppress,
        extremist feminism has nothing to do with balance. If one says that men in women should be equal, one lacks
        experience. Men and women are a lot more different than you think, especially if you have extremely feminine
        women and masculine men. </p>

    <p><strong><em> Identity.</em></strong> You have to thoroughly assess who you are, who you want to be, and how
        others should view you. I view myself as a person who always tries super hard. This makes me able to do things
        normal people wouldn't dare do. Your identity is what you will always fall back to. You may view yourself as
        lazy. 'I'm a lazy person' you would be thinking to yourself and this is going to materialize doubtlessly. Now I
        will pretend as if I'm talking to my male audience: if you view yourself as the alpha male, live and act
        accordingly, that's what people will start to treat you as. Saying I don't smoke and I try to quit smoking are
        vastly different because the quitter still views himself as a smoker. Now, if identities are useful, how do you
        change them? The first method is to change your environment. For example, skip 9th grade or move to a different
        university and present yourself how you want to be viewed. (Discussed above in the paragraph 'To all the girls
        that could have been mine') How you view yourself and how other people view you are deeply intertwined. That's
        why it's vital to make the correct first impression if people think of you that you aren't the party girl, they
        also won't be luring you to become one, even if you still think to yourself that you are a bit of a party girl.
        That means people will pull you towards your identity. But you can also push towards a certain identity and
        prove people wrong. I was not liked, I seemed to be the kid with wild and aggressive thoughts and beliefs. But
        when I started to gain muscle and to run in the gym class three times as fast as everyone else, people started
        to like me as my image started to match their observations. So, if I should get weak, I would fall back to my
        identity and people would be providing extra support to push me towards their perception of mine… Your identity
        can slow down and prevent you from climbing or it can accelerate and prevent you from falling. It can push or
        pull, you decide how to be perceived, especially on the first impression and people are going to treat you
        accordingly. That's a perfect reminder to sit upright, do you know what that does to identity? </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
    <p>Soon you will also understand why the text started the way it did. You will understand, that life is too short to
        be a feminist, to constantly fight and to resist. Life is not a philosophical text. The next section, that's the
        one where it gets deep and dark. </p>

    <h1>4. Call it destiny until you learn what it is</h1>

    <p>Not too long ago I wrote a not-so-short love letter, 3600 words where I explained meticulously as to why I love
        this girl, who rejected me. This love letter could have easily shattered the 10,000-word mark if I had
        psychoanalyzed myself and expressed every little thing, however, then I would look like a mad person, most of
        the psyche lies in the shadow. Most of your problems when it comes to love result from your inability to
        incorporate or process your shadow. An intimate relationship isn't something you can just run away from and
        there is no place to hide your shadow there. You better get to know your shadow before others get to know it.
        You don't want your life to get ruined, just because you were too incompetent to process some childhood
        nonsense, because you knew nothing and it ended up ruining you. Number one lesson of psychology - repress and it
        will pervert. </p>

    <p><em>“Good heavens, gentleman, what sort of free will is left when we come to tabulation and arithmetic, when it
            will all be a case of twice two make four? Twice two makes four without my will. As if free will meant
            that!” - Dostoyevsky.</em></p>

    <p><strong><em>Your will.</em></strong> “Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills.” - Schopenhauer.
        You have a will inside of yourself and it's directing you. You could always resist and decide things yourself,
        but that's expensive. Have you ever tried to make yourself interested in something? You have zero control of
        what brings you fulfillment of what you are interested in, or who you fall in love with. You might as well call
        this force God; it's always commanding you what to do. Resisting that will lead to a price too expensive to pay,
        a lost battle in the fight for a meaningful life. You didn't choose to will but attempting to reason it away
        won't bring anything, you must follow it or pay the price. God decided that and you are powerless. </p>

    <p><strong><em>As if free will meant that.</em></strong> Your will isn't entirely random. It may be tempting to
        think that a woman who fell for a manipulator twice or three times just got unlucky. That was true if it wasn't
        a general pattern or if it wasn't well-established knowledge that when it comes to love, people commit the same
        mistakes repeatedly. Why this specific woman was attracted to manipulators, no one knows, her childhood left her
        free of traumas, so it's sort of random. Nonetheless, as your will is not entirely random, there are some
        leverage points.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Many factors make you fall in love.</em></strong> Most of them are harmless and every ten-year-old
        knows them. None of these factors alone are enough to ignite the flame or even two. For example, the right
        smell, or to use a more sophisticated vocabulary, the compatible pheromones contribute. The compatibility of the
        pheromones is based on the immune system's capabilities and deficits along with some smaller factors. In case
        someone thinks that you are allowed to use a plastic cutting board, some perfumes or other plastics smell like
        the girls I crushed over consistently. That's horrible when you realize what's in those plastics when you smell
        on them and they smell like your crushes' sweat! The smell one is attracted to differs by person, and from your
        perspective this person is going to be the only smelling one, the rest get swept under the carpet to avoid
        sensory overload. Normally I would defend the idea of free will, but I don't know… Somehow your body just knows
        which smell you interpret as sweet. I can't describe what the smell of a girl I love smells like, but I can tell
        you that it smells like a less pungent lavender. Some other things, such as a sense of humor, common
        interests/goals, physical attraction, and body language … contribute as well. One very important aspect is also
        the voice and that's where it gets a bit darker. Men are attracted to a voice that sounds like their mothers.
        Men are attracted to behaviors that resemble that of their mothers. For example, my mother has a similar
        personality as the girl who rejected me and she wants to become a teacher while my mother is one, and that was
        all subconscious. The will is everywhere.</p>

    <p>Harmless so far.</p>

    <p><strong><em>He will ruin you.</em></strong> Now it gets very deep and dark, generally, one is attracted to the
        kind of love one receives from the parent of the opposite sex. If your father was a loser, you're practically
        destined to crave that. - If you saw that your mother had to make the phone calls instead of your father, you
        will find an attraction to the sort of man where you will do the same as your mother. Visualize how corrupt that
        is when you fall in love with a beta male while knowing that you could have done better, and then have sex as
        frequently as he will buy you flowers. You will make your life a lot worse simply because you've been
        indoctrinated with perverted experiences, values, and beliefs. I don't think you want that. If you think that
        you need that, it's your fault if you ruin your life and don't generate offspring who would make your name
        immortal. I want to instill a sense of danger and urgency here. In the paragraph where I described the 'prodigy'
        of the beta male, did you see your father in it? By the way, I'm allowed to talk ill of your father and be this
        'evil guy from the internet spreading dangerous beliefs', simply because I'm not you and your father has nothing
        to do with me. I bet your parents are not sexy, loving, trained, rich, and successful. If I'm wrong and your
        parents are the happiest bourgeois, listen to them. Instead, they are likely to indoctrinate false beliefs, they
        will tell you that just because someone is the embodiment of failure and sin, doesn't mean he's an evil person.
        But, really, who are you fooling? Most likely your parents are absolute peasants in the sense that they will
        never do anything remarkable with their lives. Remember, I'm allowed to talk ill of your parents because I don't
        know them or you. - You are not allowed to talk ill of your parents. If your father was the alpha male, you
        would want an alpha male as well. If your father didn't allow you to go to parties, you would have no problem
        listening to your alpha husband, for you it would seem normal. Of course, the reverse can be true, maybe your
        father was an alpha, and to get revenge, you get the beta. Some betas were raised perfectly and became weak for
        no reason just as there are weekly raised children who elevate themselves. Furthermore. It gets dark pretty fast
        when you start to reflect; if you are attracted to the high school dropout, manipulator, gambler, degenerative
        loser, or male feminist, they are going to ruin your life. You may fall in love with them and don't resist your
        will, suppress your heart, and turn on your brain. Of course, I'm doing black-and-white thinking here, but that
        doesn't mean you don't have a problem! Look at your problems, not at mine at this moment. You can't take the
        crackhead if you don't want to get your life ruined. There will be one girl who reads this text and ends up
        homeless by the age of 35 because she didn't listen and fell in love with the high school dropout and didn't
        resist her will, instead only saw good in him until the very last day. There will be another woman reading who
        will take the degenerating loser and lose her family's inheritance on his gambling. There is another woman who
        will be attracted to the gay fatso. This fatso will bankrupt her by the age of 29 by letting her sign a paper on
        which she gains the leadership of his business, he will manipulate her that you are much smarter than him and
        should run it and then he is going to steal the company's capital while she stays stuck with the debt. I don't
        know who you are, I will most likely never see you, so you better listen. This is not about picking the alpha
        and making your life better, this is about avoiding your life getting ruined. Men don't want the 32-year-old who
        has seen things and started to use a burgundy lipstick instead of a youthful pink one. </p>

    <p>IF YOU KNOW HE IS DEGENERATIVE, WAKE UP! YOU CANNOT WANT A FUTURE WITH HIM, RESIST YOUR WILL! TURN ON YOUR BRAIN.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Develop self-awareness.</em></strong> If you are attracted to a corrupt person, there are two things
        you can do. If it is catastrophic and you develop an interest in, let's say, a high school dropout, I would
        recommend you to get professional help, it may be possible that you won't be able to resist alone. If the
        psychologist is incompetent, he will let you talk and try to argue your problem away, by saying 'Just because he
        is a high school dropout, doesn't mean you have a problem. That's too categoric.' What I assume the psychologist
        will do if he cares about is that he will try to make you aware of your deficiencies, i.e. he will explain that
        you have some deeper problems, for example, a savior complex. Isn't the imagination of saving the crackhead
        great, setting him straight again? You must realize that if you find the embodiment of a failure sexy, you have
        some problems. Either you're the shell of a person, a broken degenerated woman, yourself or you have a savior
        complex that will ruin you at the same pace. The second thing you can do, yourself, is the same as a
        psychologist would help you with, developing a strong self-awareness. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Self-awareness </em></strong> is hard, it makes you look stupid to yourself but it's the only thing
        you can do to handle your will. You must be always reflecting as to why you do or don't do certain things.
        Self-awareness is also about having the humility to see where you could be messing up in the future. For
        example, if I continue living the way I do, I will become irresistible. If I go on a business trip,
        will I cheat if a blonde, blue-eyed, trained, educated, 1.76 m girl aggressively makes me pay attention to her?
        Maybe. Has this happened that girls were fighting for me, who were not my type, yes. Was I able to resist?
        Obviously. What if there is a girl of exactly my type who wants me and I'm taken although no one would find out
        if I cheat? Maybe. If I have the humility to admit where I could mess up by paying attention to it,<em>by being
            aware thereof</em>, I can prevent a critical mistake. </p>

    <p><strong><em>If your son was a utilitarian.</em></strong> You as a woman have a strong disadvantage when it comes
        to self-awareness because you lack the cold logic of a psychopathic killer. A woman who loves a prince will
        propagate how great her royal life is, nevertheless, when she stops loving her prince, despite nothing changing
        on the external, she will start to say how evil the prince is and that every sentence he speaks is an insult. I
        knew it was true by pure reason but I wanted to test this hypothesis empirically. I met with a girl and on a
        section of our run, I spat out 35 careful - not insults - but something a person not close to her wouldn't dare
        to say, playfully confronting her, for example, I told her that 75% of her problems are just because she doesn't
        think straight and creates problems out of thin air. A bit later, we discussed her ex, and see, turns out,
        retrospectively he insulted her in everything he said! Every other girl will say the same thing, her ex is evil
        and dumb. Endless justification. This is very general, as soon as you stop liking someone, their flaws become
        apparent. If you love the loser, you are so to speak, massively deluding yourself. “Kiryl, what you tell here
        may be correct on paper, but I still you have a too black and white perception of losers” - Let me phrase it
        infinitely stronger; if your son was a murderer, you would still love him. Somehow you would find a way to warp
        your worldview around it. Even so, you do not love another criminal foreign to you. Therefore, you need to
        reflect with two voices, with yours and with the second one close to mine. Perhaps I also need to incorporate a
        female voice in my reflection - men and women need each other.</p>

    <p>It's tempting to think that someone has a good core, despite being a total loser on the outside. You want to
        believe that one is good, but that doesn't mean that one will destroy you. Look at their actions to infer their
        motivations. Neither does it change that a winner can have a good core, stop thinking that winners are evil.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Cultivating self-awareness.</em></strong> You develop self-awareness with a few things. Many confuse
        self-awareness with thinking that your ass isn't hot, i.e. insecurity, but self-awareness goes beyond that
        because self-awareness makes you pay attention to why you are insecure about something in the first place. There
        are a few ways to increase self-awareness but this is not going to be a fast process. This level of
        consciousness requires you to turn up the volume of your inner voice, the one that's usually quiet. This quiet
        inner voice is the one that tells you to not quit that run for example or to not go to that party. The loud
        voice is the one that permanently contradicts what is good for you. The quiet inner voice lives in the parts of
        the brain responsible for discipline, self-control, partially also time perception, logic, long-term memory,
        and, most interestingly, consciousness. That means if one is a retarded junkie, one won't be able to develop
        self-awareness. This brain part is from an evolutionary perspective the newest, the forebrain or prefrontal
        cortex, the list of responsibilities of this brain part is of course radically simplified. Memories,
        consciousness, discipline, fulfillment, and self-awareness are intertwined to a point where they almost merge.
        Consequently, to elevate self-awareness, do these things.</p>

    <ol>
        <li style="line-height: normal;">
            <p><em><strong>Boost your consciousness.</strong></em> Increasing your consciousness is possible if you
                spend time with the superior and spiritual man. For men the opposite is true, spending time with you
                will bring them consciousness. This is not intended to be spiritual text, so here is the distilled
                explanation. (1) Life is a test. (2) Masculinity is order, feminity chaos. (3) Men need to contradict
                their emotions to come alive and think long-term. Women need to live in their emotions and be present
                with them. (4) Women test men with their change, thus enabling consciousness. Men bring consciousness to
                women by being unchanging, for the woman to realize that her emotions come and go. Complex spiritual
                matters won't be part of this text, as this is not a book.
                The second thing to increase your consciousness is to meditate.
            </p>

            <p><em>“Meditation is very simple. You start to focus on something, preferably your breath, and try to think
                    about nothing else. You will notice your mind wandering again eventually, and then you simply
                    refocus.
                    Refocusing again is like doing mental pushups, you don't need to be angry for losing focus, because
                    that's progress! Do this for 15 minutes every day for the rest of your life and your life quality
                    will
                    improve immensely.” - text #91 </em></p>

            <p>When you almost spoke an insult that you didn't even mean as one, mediation will be the safety rope to
                veto your poorly calibrated brain running on automatic mode and create a little pause. It will allow you
                to interfere with your thinking and set it straight. </p>


        <li style="line-height: normal;">
            <p><em><strong>Boost your memory.</strong></em> One does not need to be conscious if one has nothing to do
                except busy oneself with eating cake and the continuation of the species, that's why paradise is boring
                by the way. If your life consists of only school, meeting friends, and playing volleyball games once a
                week, there is no real reason for your brain to be turned on. That's 5-20% of what you are truly capable
                of and these 5-20% become automated pretty fast. The longer you do the same things, the less you need
                your problem-solving consciousness. There are many names: muscle memory, mastery, machine, … - they all
                don't need consciousness to function. A peasant who gets up, works, and then sleeps needs no
                self-awareness and neither does the goldfish. Consciousness is proportional not only to the stillness of
                mediation but also to the confusion of life, if nothing is happening, there will be no memories created.
                If no memories are created, and instead you are lingering in constant repetition, your brain will turn
                off, yet you need your brain to be self-aware running on an elevated state of mind. Doing new things
                makes you learn more about yourself and that will automatically increase your self-awareness. I know,
                for example, I'm going to study in Dresden. But I will not move to Dresden until two days before
                university starts, because I know that I would mentally just wait instead of work. I have this
                self-awareness because I have been in that situation often. To learn more about yourself! Go on some
                adventures. Learn a new sport. Learn a musical instrument. Learn how to read and how to write. Or, after
                you write an exam on a random February Thursday and the weather is depressively gray, go for a 40km bike
                to the peak of your local mountains. That's going to make your life more interesting and fuller, you
                will create more memories to look back on.
            </p>
        </li>


        <li style="line-height: normal;">
            <p><strong><em>Boost your discipline.</em></strong> Since discipline, consciousness, and memories are the
                same thing such as E = mc² which says that mass and energy are the same thing in different forms, other
                formulas predict that mass, energy, and information are the same thing. Other physical models predict
                that information is equal to disorder and disorder to time, so time, disorder, information, energy, and
                mass are all intertwined in complicated ways just as the ways to establish self-awareness. Discipline is
                resisting your animalistic brain temptations - which is the practice of interfering in your automatic,
                mindless voices, just as meditation. Discipline is as simple as never touching sweets. </p>
        </li>


        <li style="line-height: normal;">
            <p><strong><em>Pause and reflect.</em></strong> Look in the mirror to see what you've become and whether
                that's the person you want to be. Use a notebook to write down your thoughts. Spend less time being
                mentally absent, for example on the internet or with mentally retarded. Write a diary. </p>
        </li>

    </ol>

    <p><em>“Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why so great a proportion of men, long after nature has released them
            from alien guidance […], nonetheless gladly remain in lifelong immaturity, and why it is so easy for others
            to establish themselves as their guardians. It is so easy to be immature.” - Kant</em></p>

    <p>When you develop superior self-awareness and start to understand why you behave you do or why you are attracted
        to certain people, you may realize how stupid you are. To a man I would say, don't be scared to be dumb and to
        change everything about your life. That's why only the superior person dares to think and reflect in the first
        sense, most are too scared of what it may reveal. But don't be scared, you continue to be the dumb girl, or you
        get to know yourself, and use this as a basis to make decisions. Or, you get smart, get to know yourself, and
        develop enough self-awareness to see through, and maybe you can start to seduce and manipulate men while
        pretending to be the meek girl yourself. </p>

    <p>Furthermore, many so-called desires, worries, and fears disappear on paper. </p>

    <p>Thinking is hard, so let me direct it, discovering everything yourself would take more time than you have.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Attachment styles.</em></strong> When you have enough self-awareness, other concepts make a lot more
        sense. For example, the theory of attachment styles is known as 'mommy issues' or 'daddy issues' in the
        collective vocabulary, although they are not congruent. A less orthodox version of Freund's 'mommy and daddy'
        issues have been discussed above, with you choosing a partner resembling your parents and building your
        expectations around it, if your father was effectively absent because he was a beta or was too incompetent to
        navigate the marriage, that's what you will likely desire. There are 4 attachment styles.</p>

    <ol>
        <li style="line-height: normal;">
            <p><em><strong>Secure.</strong></em> This attachment style is the one you will find in the couple that
                stayed together from their late teen years to their death. This couple isn't controlling or the absent
                opposite, but rather the golden middle. Children free of traumas are the derivative and a stable
                household. This couple trusts each other and finds the optimum of independence, communication, and
                closeness.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li style="line-height: normal;">
            <p><em><strong>Anxious.</strong></em> This is one of the three corrupted ones; the other corrupted ones are
                the avoidant and the fearful-avoidant. Anxious attachment in hardened men comes through as being
                controlling in excess, (him not allowing you to dress like a whore is not excessive control). Softer men
                start to behave like you would expect from women because they don't want to lose you, they raise you to
                Goddess status. If you were anxious, you would be doing the same thing, that's when you were to call him
                4 times a day or felt like hugging him for 2 hours a day. If you are both avoidant, you both want to hug
                each other for 2 hours daily and that deteriorates the relationship the instant that the initial
                attraction wears off and you start to mistrust each other. Sweet paranoia. The anxious type is the one
                who trusts people and gets disappointed or abandoned many times. This type wants to be close, but
                closeness brings the potential for betrayal.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li style="line-height: normal;">
            <p><em><strong>Avoidant.</strong></em> The second cursed attachment style. That's when the woman grows
                desirous of the incompetent, degenerating, emotionally unavailable (you will think he is neither of
                these things) loser or the typical high school dropout. In my experience, women aren't avoidant
                themselves too often, they rather fancy the avoidant male. That's another reason why a beta father will
                traumatize your children, by being absent and weak. If he is a bit awkward, how is he supposed to offer
                emotional support to your daughter? That's what will make her desire the avoidant type, which will ruin
                her. Do you want your daughter to sleep with the love of her life or because you made some mistakes with
                twenty random guys who abandoned her just as your potential loser husband? My perspective is too
                limited, I don't know how the avoidant style manifests in women. Read more on this subject yourself. The
                avoidant style is just as much of a coward as the anxious, they are too stupid to face their life and
                instead, escape into 'mommy's hug' (anxious) or 'running away from home' (avoidant).
            </p>
        </li>

        <li style="line-height: normal;">
            <p><em><strong>A total mess.</strong></em> Some people happen to be avoidant and anxious at the same time.
                They will not live great lives. They don't know what they want, i.e. their blind will is chaotic without
                ends. Unfortunately, I don't understand much about this type.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>What needs to be said is that you shouldn't blame anyone for their attachment style. Only blame them if they
        don't learn or don't try to. Also, attachment styles are fully independent of for example if one is a
        proletarian or a bourgeois. You can have a king who can't live 10 minutes without his woman just as you can have
        a king who leaves his wife with the children at home and goes to conquer the world, just to stay out of home. I
        have great news for you when you realize that you may have an undesirable style. When I first learned about
        them, I knew that I had an anxious one, but not very strong. That was almost a year ago and since then I
        transformed myself into a secure one, just with the power of pure reason and logic and a lot of mediation. It
        just faded away. By the way, anxious and avoidant attachments don't go well together, life is not math where +1
        and -1 equal zero. I also know some women who used to have anxious attachments and these wounds healed after
        being in relationships. Generally, knowledge, reflection, self-awareness, and open communication will make you
        into a greater partner. Maybe even a superior partner, I don't know many people who dare to be wise.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Savior complex.</em></strong> This is just as common in men as in women and is caused by a lack of
        self-awareness. Some men will want a broken woman to feel the pleasure that comes from saving her. For example,
        in Dostoyevsky's book “Notes from the Underground”, the nameless protagonist is sick and spiteful towards life
        and is like many of Dostoyevsky's books' characters a loser. He is 40 and works as a clerk where he
        intentionally makes the life of everyone draining and annoying. The day he gets some inheritance, he quits his
        job and lingers around doing nothing. He not only is full of resentment but is also arrogant because he thinks
        that he is well-read. The book is 100 pages long, but you can also find many nuances I discuss on my blog, for
        example, the aspect that paradise is nonsense, that consciousness can be a curse, and whether free will is real.
        One interesting aspect of this book is that he meets a prostitute, Liza, and wants to 'save' her, after having a
        sentimental conversation with her. </p>

    <p><em>“One day passed, however, another and another; she did not come and I began to grow calmer. I felt
            particularly bold and cheerful after nine o'clock, I even sometimes began dreaming, and rather sweetly: I,
            for instance, became the salvation of Liza, simply through her coming to me and my talking to her.… I
            develop her, educate her. Finally, I notice that she loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to
            understand (I don't know, however, why I pretend, just for effect, perhaps). At last all confusion,
            transfigured, trembling and sobbing, she flings herself at my feet and says that I am her savior and that
            she loves me better than anything in the world”</em></p>

    <p>Liza meets the underground man and she is so disgusted by him that she wants to have nothing to do with him
        anymore, she notices that there is nothing real about him, just as seen in the quote above. The prostitute may
        be a loser, but she has more integrity than the underground man who tries to save her. By the way, the author
        Dostoyevsky made a male fantasy very alive here, a woman who is perfectly submissive and stupid. </p>

    <p>“Well, what about Jesus then? Didn't he say to love everyone? Aren't you praying like 2 hours daily?” Not quite -
        Jesus is perfect and you are you. Also, if you are using Christian morals, then you also have to listen to your
        husband and not spend time with random losers, it would be obvious to spend time with people that elevate the
        soul. Instead, you want to relieve your pressure by feeling superior. “I got a 14/15” and the inferior may
        respond with “I got a 0/15. Life is so unfair. The stupid teachers drag down, yeah! Don't understand how you're
        so good.” And maybe you will do the same thing as the underground man, you are going to say “Maybe we should
        meet next week and I will help you do your presentation and maybe I can send you, my conspectus.” Endless
        validation. Addictive gratification. By the way, similar thing with social media and
        validation/attention/addictive gratification… And now I have to look at myself, if I try hard enough, I can make
        any girl look like a retard, but I don't, I don't want to get humbled and besides, I don't have to, no one ever
        doubted that I'm kind of special. Also, I'm generally not as harsh as I seem to be on text, which is true for
        every internet personality, they are either a lot better than they seem or a lot more sinister. </p>

    <p>“Well, Kant said that helping is moral.” It makes you feel like a mother if you take care of the loser. But you
        are running his life. If you tell an alcoholic that it's ok to drink once in a while you are making his life a
        lot worse in the long run. With my friends, who are no losers, but by far not as disciplined, I never tell them
        that using social media is ok. You can think of my reaction when a friend told me that he was going to sleep for
        7.5 hours every day. I don't listen to any excuses. Sometimes I ask them what their life is supposed to be about
        and this approach is highly effective. I know that the superior man should motivate others with warm words, but
        I haven't reached this level yet. I do, however, consciously use far more compliments, especially for women. In
        essence, with your reckless excuses, you promote weakness and are likely to make the life of your victim a lot
        worse.</p>

    <p>You overcome the savior complex either through pure reason or through empiricism. Either because you start to
        wear burgundy lipstick instead of pink as a metaphor for making many mistakes and growing up or because you
        realize that the pleasure of attention from a low-quality person isn't that valuable. If you want endless
        attention, get a dog. (I don't want dogs, my mother got two dogs and I didn't start to love them, they are still
        annoying as hell. One time I had to repeat a sentence 7 times while recording a video because the á 2 kg dogs
        kept barking the hell out of their lungs every time I was halfway through.) You will also accept that the loser
        doesn't want to be saved. He wants to suffer, if he didn't want to, why didn't he start to do 150 pushups a day
        and sit upright? Stop feeling pity for people who are incapable of taking responsibility. Let go of them before
        it's too late and realize that you only want them because of the sweet brain chemicals they make you release.
    </p>

    <p>By the way, if you want to feel superior, there are a few things you can do. Do pushups and sit upright. It will
        make you feel like rubbish if you aren't able to do 5, but when you reach a level of 150 pushups a day, that's
        when you will start beyond what is. There are many other tips to feel superior without running someone else's
        life in the process, for example, learn something and then beat every person at this craft fast. Become so
        strong that resisting sweets will seem like low-level stuff. However, I don't want you to turn into a man, thus,
        the dog may be the better option. </p>

    <p>Reality is never as simple as just a single concept, thus, it's not absurd to assume another reason why you may
        have a slight savior complex, which is that you want a child to take care of badly. If that's true, perhaps you
        should reassess your career choice, so that you live a life that's more meaningful to you. This only adds
        further reason why you aren't allowed to take a random loser; he will be fundamentally unable to offer you the
        life you want. </p>

    <p>More in texts #28 and #98.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, what you may not understand is that you are, at least, partially attracted to them because you
        haven't resolved your attachment issues. If you found them not attractive at all, you would find another
        pleasure and validation squad, so don't try to deny your slight attraction. The mindless guy who lives like the
        crackhead - is mentally fully absent (#104) and this makes you attracted to him in some ways, mostly
        subconsciously, reminiscent of your emotionally unavailable father. Perhaps you are strong enough to resist
        falling in love with him, maybe you're not. I don't know. What you are doing in any case is torturing them. You
        are torturing those losers by spending time with them and giving them hope that they will play out their sexual
        fantasy on you. That's close to sadism - from your side. Your shadow is more prevalent than you think it is. If
        you knew what they dreamt of and weren't sadistic, you wouldn't hesitate to write “I've changed, we should not
        spend time together anymore. Was nice thou.” You are not a nice person if you are sadistically inclined and have
        a savior complex, especially considering that you think you are helping. Savior complex is the sadism of the
        sweetest kind. </p>

    <p>No matter how subtle the impact, they will drag you down. Directly if you go to parties with them, more subtly
        are other examples. For example, you will need to use another body language when talking to an alpha than to the
        embodiment of failure. You may ruin your ability to talk to attractive men, they will think that something is
        off about you because your body language won't match with who they perceive you as. You will become stupid if
        you talk to stupid people. You are the average of the people you spend time with. When the alpha males see you,
        they will think something approximately like 'she spends time with the worst kind of men, she must be attracted
        to those, therefore she does not want me, she must be broken because of some childhood trauma, or she has a
        sadistic inclination'. Do you want that? If you have male friends, at least be friends with men your girlfriends
        would envy. Those at the top will never advise you to go to parties or to be dumb. How do you figure out if they
        are at the top? Well, it comes back to sitting upright…</p>

    <p>Imagine ruining your life because you didn't realize that the reason you are degrading yourself is because you
        are too weak to resist some brain chemicals! All because you lacked self-awareness.</p>

    <p><strong><em>My male friends are alphas, not crackheads.</em></strong> If you're able to talk to them, it means
        they like to some extent, if you have access to men of the best kind, what are you waiting for? </p>

    <p><strong><em>The manipulator.</em></strong> There is a certain type of person that makes you see death the first
        time you look them in the eyes. In text #104 I described in very exhaustive detail this kind of person, they
        aren't too common, in my environment, I could identify 2 after my mother learned the hard way how a manipulator
        functions. This concept is highly related to spiritual awakening. Firstly, you have to understand that your mind
        runs with a thinking voice as default. But that's horrible and makes you think weird things, for example, it
        makes you fear death or desire social media, and it makes you unhappy. Either you numb your mind to turn it off,
        or you embrace full consciousness with meditation. But both of these approaches require a soul, some people
        don't have one, and they aren't going to hell because they just die as if they never existed. In philosophy,
        this person is called a zombie, a person unable to have experiences as consciousness would predict and instead
        live a purely material existence, like a simple single cellular organism or a goldfish. Their lives are mostly
        total messes. They are ungrateful, nihilistic, lazy, undisciplined, cheating, and hedonistic, many of them take
        drugs, gamble, and use people as means to ends. The aspect of means to ends needs further elaboration, if they
        look at you and don't have a soul, they view you as an object and objects exist to be used. The eyes are not
        connected to the body, they are above the brain barrier, hence, they are a direct connection to the brain and
        that's what reveals the truth. I have learned how to identify this kind of person empirically, but of course,
        you won't see it yourself and get corrupted yourself. The first impression matters a lot more than you think. Of
        course, some of these degenerates happen to be smart but are still off when you look them in the eyes the first
        time. They make you see death when you look them in the eyes. Because they make you see death, you can easily
        mistake them for the alpha. You will find this loser mysterious and interesting and fall for him. </p>

    <p>I knew in my environment of 100 students there were 2 people without a soul, both of them were how I just
        described and also like the person I gained this knowledge empirically through, i.e. who left deep scars in me.
        Guess who fell for one of them? Months later, I heard that the same person fell for the second one as well and
        for the next 6 weeks, I wanted to deny what I heard, simultaneously I was a bit weak in September/October 2023
        after losing programming and my apps as a purpose I had for a long time. I thought, what the hell? I fear, she
        is not smart enough to learn and ignores all warnings. It does not seem she learns fast. Hopefully, she learns
        faster than the dark red lipstick. In any case, it's her fault. No matter what happens, one must take radical
        responsibility. If you want to say that I'm talking nonsense, turns out many of her female friends don't like
        him either. One could say that I should get to know him better to discover that I misjudged him from what I have
        observed. I fear that's too late, if you start to see a person as a manipulator, this belief is unbelievably
        immutable. If the first impression is corrupted and the hundred follow-up ones, there is no way to restore it.
        Especially if you start to shake when you see him, despite your certain knowledge that he won't harm you and his
        possibly existent confusion. I guess, I'm lost on this front. Despite everything I wrote, I did develop and now
        the negative ties are already a lot weaker, but I will never be able to trust him, specifically because from my
        perspective he wants my girl. I do have the self-awareness to realize, that I myself may be falling victim to
        the savior complex towards that girl who does not want my help. </p>

    <p>Now you may be asking what the core of this text is. Is it for me to point out the mistakes and prevent future
        ones of the girl who rejected me? Is it to process me having a beta father? Is it to encourage other girls to
        live wise so that I increase my chances of getting one? True, but the core of this text is for you to embrace
        mediation, 80% of your problems would evaporate this way. If you were high in self-awareness and reflected on
        whether you should spend time with those people or go to that party and the answer was no, your life would be
        magnitudes better. If you aren't meditating, you have no right to complain, ever. </p>


    <p><strong><em>Men want sex only.</em></strong> You may be tempted to think that I'm different, that I write my
        texts and never talk to women and never play with seducing them. You may think that your male friends just want
        to be friends. Some men are too unattractive to ever get a woman. Some men are open about it. Some men try to
        repress (subconsciously) or suppress (consciously) it or transmute their sexual energy towards their projects.
        However, none of them would reject a model if she came begging on the door except for the superior man who is
        attractive but sees life's meaning in deeper aspects, such as Kant, Newton, Warhol, or Tesla, they all knew what
        they were doing. Chances are, the guys you spend time with are not Newtons or Kants, otherwise they wouldn't be
        talking to you. This kind of man, who finds meaning in other things, which I used to identify with until not too
        long ago, finds women boring while being a bit antisocial too. This makes me wonder, maybe in 2023, my life has
        taken a wrong turn? </p>

    <p><em>“In this story, I never talked about friends, women, hobbies, fun, or parties. That's because they didn't
            exist. I think it's very hard to understand for outsiders how that happened, but one thing is certain. A
            life like this is rare or not even replicable. This was just the last two and a half years - imagine what's
            going to happen once I gain more experience and everything will start to compound” - text #6</em></p>

    <p>From the text with the title; “The only way to live”, from June 2023 where I look back on sacrificing 2.5 years.
        That's what the voluntary depravity of women does, not one of desperation when paired with the right personality
        type; hard work. I wanted to mention, I lived like that and visualize my confusion when I got rejected by a
        girl! Took me till January to figure out that she was taken. Luckily, I'm back at living this way of life, but a
        bit more relaxed, if you're able to write 10,000-word texts on practically a daily basis while training like a
        beast and going on adventures regularly, you can leave some energy for a loving woman.</p>

    <p>Many philosophers or artists may say that they are living what I described how I used to live but that's simply
        incorrect. I never had a lack of women. For example, in Hamburg 2022 a blonde girl wanted my Instagram, but I
        didn't use Instagram. In 2020 or 2021 after a chemistry lesson where I obliterated everyone with my intellect, a
        girl asked me whether I wanted to have a permanent (in German 'fest', also synonym for immoveable) and educated
        girlfriend, and till this day, I remember that I should have answered with “No she has to be able to move”,
        instead I just declined. From 5th grade on, there was a girl who had a crush on me and who I had a crush on
        until I skipped over 9th grade, but I found her ugly, which I know contradicts what I wrote 10.000 words ago.
        So, I come to a lot closer to the man who doesn't need women to live a meaningful and I'm perhaps the closest
        person to this archetype you will ever get to know. Yet, I left this identity behind me, in March 2023 when I
        developed an interest for the girl one could think I'm writing this text for. Shaped me a lot, so far we weren't
        together. In essence, if the guy is of the superior kind, you can trust him if he doesn't want you. If he is low
        status, i.e. doesn't sit upright, I wouldn't be so sure. </p>

    <p>You may be wondering if I lust over my female friends and whether my observation has some exceptions so that you
        can cope yourself. One of them is prettier, so sometimes, the other one is far away from the blonde girl I would
        dream of. </p>


    <p>But it's different with the betas. The beta males fall in love with every woman who shows them attention. They
        are desperate since they know that women don't desire a man who lives by the motto of “I saw. I came. I crumbled
        the hell out of the kitchen to the annoyance of my wife” If you show attention to a curvy back guy, he won't be
        able to but crush on you, he will daydream of having sex with you. He may know that he won't be able to ask you
        out directly, so he will wait, hoping for the right opportunity. For example, he could 'provide emotional
        support' during a breakup. Also, what you have to understand about men, is that they may love their wives, but
        that doesn't change that they want always more women. So, even when this loser is taken, doesn't mean he stopped
        daydreaming over you. Men enjoy the hunt so to speak. If you gave the beta male the chance, he would sleep
        with you without a second thought, even if he is taken. That's also not necessarily different if you're a 4/10,
        you can't believe how much of a deficit most men have. </p>

    <p>Hence, male friends, parties, girls' nights out, alcohol, and clothes that reveal the belly, are all taboo,
        especially if you want to attract high-value men, and with certainty if you are together with one, i.e. if you
        take your life seriously. Everyone knows what drunk men in a party do and want, everyone knows what you want to
        imply if you dress immodestly. From a man's perspective, if you are his, and still talk to other guys or use
        social media, you are leaving a hole in the castle he built to let in the barbarians. It makes life complicated
        without ends as it eliminates trust (text #120). If you have problems in your relationship and don't break free
        from your male friends, your male friends will use your vulnerability and 'provide emotional support' which
        probably contradicts your best interest as well as that of your future bloodline and your boyfriend. And then my
        grandmother, ethics teacher, male and female friends try to convince me that the beta male isn't evil.
        Doubtlessly met many evil ones. Even worse if you provoke the barbarians to enter. You simply can't ignore that
        men want sex only, they can't view you as just a friend, while you can.</p>

    <p><strong><em>We are just friends.</em></strong> In case I missed something or you weren't receptive to my warnings
        or lessons, I want you to decide who is more valuable. This paragraph is my character development from this
        text, I accept that not all are evil and that some things I don't know. Still… Sacrifice them. What are you
        telling him, if you need other men? </p>

    <p><strong><em>Men want virgins, some can't handle being second.</em></strong> If you have a boyfriend or husband
        and he buys you flowers once a week and is poetically romantic in everything he does and you have a wonderful
        loving time, and you enjoy that he tries hard to win your heart and to impress you, enjoy it. This phase will
        end if he asks you whether you are a virgin and you respond with no. If you tell him no, he might not be able to
        process it. It's going to make his efforts seem meaningless to him and you will start to wonder why he will grow
        a slight resentment towards you out of nothing. He will obsess about it and this thought is going to rot him
        from within. “This random girl didn't pick me as her first choice, someone else must have been better why should
        I try hard?” Whether the relationship survives or not is a matter of probability, not being a virgin will be 60%
        of the reason for a breakup if it comes, consciously, not subconsciously. This is one reason no one would ever
        share with anybody as it seems absurd to talk about. That's why perhaps no one ever told you anything. I doubt
        you have any idea of what it feels like when his girl has been used by another man. It feels as if you get hit
        by the wooden stick of a broom on your belly button. This pain will not fade, it's permanent. This pain is so
        primal that there is no way to 'mediate it away'. If you know that your man is somewhat similar to me and not a
        desperate beta, he will not get over it, ever. The desperate beta would be hurt too, but persist. It will damage
        any trust you may have built, and further questions he may hesitate to ask for a month will make you seem like a
        liar in his eyes (remember the emotional justification of mothers loving their sons even if they are murderers).
        He will not be able to remove an image out of his mind of what another man did to you and now I should stop
        describing further for my mental health. After finding out, a period starts where he thinks of breaking up and
        if doesn't, he will forever view you as less. Sorry if this hurt. You can't understand the deep pain that this
        knowledge brings, so the breakup 6 months later may come to you as a total surprise. I don't want to be in your
        shoes either, because it will seem absurd to you, especially if you are reading this and know that you aren't a
        virgin. </p>

    <p>Let me put it differently to make you understand better. Let's say you open the yearbook and ask your man to show
        you which girls he has or had a crush on. You may find this knowledge amusing and cute. However, the reverse
        isn't true, you better shut up about the 12 crushes you had on random losers. Some women love their men to the
        point where they would allow them to sleep with other women. Believe it or not, the opposite is not possible.
    </p>

    <p>Only a few high-value men will be able to accept and come to peace with it, life is not a philosophical text, but
        still, the damage in trust can't be restored and he will try as hard again. He too will weaken his determination
        and become fat later on, he too will find no reason to fight hard. He would view himself as having failed at the
        game of love and think to be left with the crumbs, I know that sounds degrading and I don't intend to hurt you.
        He may get somewhat over it if he was promiscuous himself or if you only had sex with two guys who you've been
        in a relationship with for á 5 and 3 years which didn't work out, if the guys were similar enough to be friends,
        not arch enemies. He may get over it with only a bit of damage in trust created. - If you are lucky. </p>

    <p>So, you may be tempted to think to just keep your mouth shut and that's what I would recommend. If he persists
        and wants to know it, I have no clue what to recommend. Decide yourself. What you must not do under any
        circumstances is brag about how many men you slept with; I hope I didn't have to write this sentence down. I
        know that refusing to answer may also break the trust and answering most likely will. What you shouldn't do is
        lie. You can't know what he knows. You have to assume he knows something you don't want him to. He will talk to
        all of your friends to figure out who you are and he will look you up on the internet. If you lie and it comes
        out, you've magnified the damage. </p>

    <p>I don't know if I would be able to handle a girl who isn't a virgin. I have high enough self-awareness to admit
        that I might not. I'm secure and confident and I likely couldn't handle it! This paragraph alone is why I write
        this text, I want to free myself from this daemon that haunted me for over 2 years. I had multiple thoughts in
        parallel and they all contradict each other. Attractive virgins are rare, but I'm attractive. When I'm next to a
        girl and she isn't a virgin, I don't think less of her, instead, I accept who she is, but that may trick, as I
        don't care about the other girls and when it comes to the girls I want, if they aren't virgins and the initial
        attraction wears off, this could become a real problem. Another argument was that of divine authority, only when
        I was willing to take God's gifts should I get them, i.e. the perfect woman will emerge and I will get her if
        I'm willing to sacrifice my ego and find redemption in my faith, or put simply, I would mature and then get the
        perfect woman. I also thought that I was limiting myself with my thinking and that if were to pick a woman who
        didn't pick me first, I would do a favor to no one. But I doubt that's going to happen for me. The killer
        argument came when I talked with my friends about this issue and they said something like 'You will find your
        virgin, don't worry'. Recently I started to consider that I wouldn't stop loving her if she wasn't a virgin and
        that she could still be decent. Around the girl I love, I don't get a higher pulse anymore, so the initial
        attraction faded, and still, I want her, even if I count on her being not a virgin, despite not being sure about
        it fully. Therefore, it remains a question of empiricism to figure out whether I could handle it, pure reason
        laid the first bricks. Hopefully, I will never need to learn it empirically. </p>

    <p>Some grandmothers may think to herself that it simply doesn't matter and that it's no one's business. How can it
        be no one's business if you potentially spend the rest of your life together and how can you say it doesn't
        matter after what I described and what other men think about this matter? Also, statistically, it does matter.
        Spiritually even more. The first breakup takes months to process because the bond is incredibly strong, just as
        with a piece of tape. When you try to remove the tape from the wall, it may tear apart and the glue becomes
        weaker each time. This realization can make even the playboy cry when he realizes what his hedonism has led him
        to. Couples are statistically more likely to break up and cheat on each other the more partners they had prior.
        The third marriage, for instance, has a divorce rate of 73%, and the first one just 50%. There is a lot of
        empirical evidence for it. As soon as you start to use burgundy lipstick, you will also realize what the
        sentences I'm about to say mean; if you had multiple partners, you will also have to deal with demons and curses
        from the countless other bloodlines, in addition to that of your husbands. Furthermore, you release your traumas
        to the person with whom you lost your virginity and tie your traumas to him, and no one outside of him will have
        the ability to redeem you, so you better hope your first pick was the right one. When it doesn't make sense what
        I said, wait until you get old.</p>

    <p><em>And it all brings us back to making the wrong decisions because you didn't know what shaped your will. You
            call the breakup destiny because you didn't know anything about men. Stop naïve or at least hedonistic. If
            you want to be a good girl and get the best husband, put yourself in your great-grandmother's shoes. But I
            think you're a smart girl and learned your lesson, hopefully before it was too late. Do you want your
            childhood to take control of you in the shadows and ruin your life on the side? Call it destiny until you
            learn what it is.</em></p>

    <h1>5. I don't live for my man, I have my own life</h1>

    <p><strong><em>The controller.</em></strong> If your man wants to control you beyond that you're not allowed to use
        social media, wear provoking clothes, go to parties, or spend time with indecent women and have male friends.
        Drop him, he doesn't trust you. He isn't necessarily evil, you just don't fit together, he views you as an
        indecent woman and he sort of tries to save you by taking control. But you don't want to be saved, just like
        your male equivalent. Or maybe he is just a manipulator. Maybe he has also an anxious attachment, but you can
        fix this problem, otherwise break up. Give yourself a week to decide. </p>

    <p><strong><em>I want to be Newton.</em></strong> Most likely you never will, for one Newton there are a million
        nobodies. You should not forget that most men stand no chance against the ruthless top 0.0001%, why should you?
        Some women are immature and will become cat ladies if they don't mature fast enough. Others are more masculine
        than most men and no one should interfere here, they shall live alone. Surprisingly, those women are often the
        ones who dress modestly and never go to parties. Maybe you don't need a man</p>

    <p><strong><em>My man says this text is nonsense.</em></strong> Is the man you would lust over after having removed
        your childhood traumas and resolved other mental issues? If I met him, do you think I would view him as the
        alpha? Is he perfect beyond that and do you love each other with your full hearts? If so, I can take a deep
        breath and feel a bit lighter that you found the right one for you. I congratulate you. </p>

    <p>Outside of that, I don't see any exceptions.</p>

    <p><strong><em>No man wants to be how women want them either.</em></strong> Then don't get a loser. Some men will be
        able to break your expectations. Remember this text is about how to be a good girl, not a rebel who then gets
        the embodiment of sin and failure since he will be 'just as imperfect as you' because you deteriorated yourself,
        all because you knew nothing about anything. Some men are characterized by “I saw. I came. I crumbled the
        kitchen to the annoyance of my wife.”, but not all. Do you think that there are no men who will write you a
        3600-word love letter or bring gifts at random? </p>

    <p>Also, what makes you think that you know what you want?</p>

    <p><strong><em>Do you exist to go to parties?</em></strong> I don't see why you should think that you want social
        media if you know more than enough about its negatives. Saying that you want to use it because of feminism which
        allows you to do so is like using the Lord's word to justify a genocide, it completely misses the point and puts
        shame onto that which should be holy. I believe that you don't want to use social media, it's your loud monkey
        voice that commands you to. If you don't exist for parties or other hedonism, what then? For your husband?
        Almost. You exist for God, for your parents, for your husband, for your children, and for your entire future
        bloodline. If you exist just for yourself, good luck with living a meaningful life. Simply put your children as
        the goal of your existence if you are tempted by your reckless friends to go to a party. If you exist for your
        children, make sure they don't get traumatized by you picking the beta male. I haven't fully recovered from
        growing up fatherless and then with a beta and chances are, your children will not have the strength to recover
        themselves, they are not me. You are responsible for your offspring. Think long-term. A party goes on one
        evening, a good relationship and entire life. How many parties do you need to visit to realize that they are
        boring? </p>

    <p>Again, from a purely empirical perspective, the partner you take is the most important aspect of life
        satisfaction. Either you contradict each other or add up to be greater than the sum of the parts. You will spend
        an unbelievable amount of time together. There are many big questions in life. If to commit suicide, who to
        marry, when to have children, and which religion to follow. Some smaller decisions are which country to live in
        or which job to take. Insignificant decisions are what to wear. Don't mess up the order. It's more important to
        find the right one, than it is to pick your career or to pick a loser. Your life looks pretty much the same if
        you work as an accountant or as a teacher, but it does make a massive difference whether you have a billionaire
        at home or a crackhead. </p>

    <h1>6. What marriage is for</h1>

    <p><em><strong>Before marriage, there's perhaps a breakup.</strong></em> Firstly, no parties or degenerate friends
        to cope with your loss. What I do recommend is a very hardcore method, which admittedly is too hard for most to
        be practical, so I will present an easier version. Lie in bed as if you were sick with decent discipline. If you
        cut out chocolate, music, internet, … and give your mind to process things, you can recover 80% in as little as
        two days. Some will need 14 days of resting with less ruthless discipline. I have a text (#88) where I described
        in detail how to stop thinking about your ex. The method works as follows. Firstly, if you go through a breakup,
        you may notice that your IQ drops by 35% for a few days, or at least you feel so. That's because you have to
        understand if you long thought of a person, and did it repetitively, and thinking it pleased you, the neural
        pathways hardwire themselves even further. For example, a knife is universal but slow, but if you were to cut
        bread, you would use a bread cutter, as it's way more efficient. If you need to cut bread a lot, you are more
        like to construct a bread cutter. The same applies to learning. Your brain transforms the knife into the bread
        cutter or chain saw at will, to use it for what is most needed. Therefore, one of the things that will help you
        to get over it is to learn new things. That will force your brain to get rewired and contribute to breaking free
        from the harder established neural connections from thinking about that person. The second part of the method is
        to accept that what's redundant won't happen. The third part of the method is to understand conditioning. For
        example, I started to associate going for walks with the girl who rejected me and I was able to break this link
        by going for walks and specifically discarding these thoughts. Discarding thoughts at will weakens the
        established neural connections and breaks the conditioning. Refusing to think a thought is possible and guess
        how you practice it. With meditation. It's not only similar, it's precisely the same thing. If you need
        something to think about instead of your ex, so that you can disregard this thought, think to yourself “Am I
        living how God wants me to”. Disregarding thoughts feels hard but you will only need to do it for an
        unbelievably short two days. It will make your head hurt, but it will go heal faster than you think. You won’t
        get depressed as much if you lie in bed and learn to unthink, if you are disciplined, this gives space for the
        energy to release. If you hate yourself, do pushups. If you are tired of pushups, go and take an ice bath. And I
        hope you take this seriously, although I know that this would strengthen your masculine energy, but momentarily,
        that's ok. This is much better than succumbing to depression which makes you feel too weak to do anything. Also,
        to stop thinking about your ex, cut ties, mainly, block them on everything. Stay busy, best case if with hard
        sports and reading. Light sports the volleyball game or running will make things worse because if you are on a
        run, you have time to think, which you shouldn't. Hard sports mean for example doing a hundred pushups or
        running 600 meters in 90 seconds. Depression does a fairly similar thing; it turns off your consciousness for
        time to pass and for wounds to heal. The difference is: who is in control. Talking with others can backfire if
        they express how great he was. Looking at his negatives can too if you realize that there weren't many. But, let
        your feminine side out and revert to your family (that's what many men find very attractive), and let your
        emotions out. Allow yourself to be weak. The final thing you can do is take out a piece of paper and write until
        you run out of thoughts and fall asleep with unexpected peace. </p>


    <p>Now you may be tempted to ask why I keep referring to this girl despite being rejected twice by her and bringing
        me mostly sadness only. Well, it's fun… I know that I'm strong enough to break free and to choose the thoughts,
        I think. Furthermore, it made my character development, say, 5x faster. It's simply not in my interest to give
        up. Also, I stopped loving her, in the sense of childish love a few months ago, and now I think to myself, I
        think she is an amazing person, I would like to have her in my life and I think we would make a great couple and
        I still love her. I see her for the last time in my life on this Friday, but she knows where and when to
        encounter me on the street... Whether she loves me and thinks that I'm the right one, I don't know. </p>

    <p><em>From now on, the I narrator does not always refer to me, but sometimes to any partner and yourself.</em></p>

    <p><strong><em>You and I are horrible.</em></strong> We are monsters, so we have to make sure we can't run away from
        each other. If you knew what's going on in my head, you would run away and the same is true for me. That's why
        we got married, to be stuck with each other. </p>

    <p>Look, my blog can scare everyone off and so can my daily appearance. When you get to know me truly, you will
        realize that you can tell me everything and I will listen. I get friendlier if you get to know me. But my deep
        reflections make me look like a monster, which everyone at their core is, at least, in parts. </p>

    <p>Novelty - Loyalty; Exploration - Trust; Chase - Journey. Which are more valuable for you in the long run?</p>

    <p><strong><em>Taking a car for a test ride.</em></strong> “Well, you obviously should drive a car to figure out if
        you want to buy it, just as you take clothes on and off in a clothing store. Don't be silly. You want to try out
        your partner in the same way you would a car” That's where the problem lies. You're not a car. At least, I hope.
        I think you are more complicated than that. You may be tempted to think that you should be together for a while
        to get to know each other. </p>

    <p><strong><em>You are the best I can get right now, that's why we don't marry.</em></strong> Assume momentarily
        that I'm incompetent, naïve, and desperate; what would you be telling me if we lived together, to give marriage
        a try so to speak? Let's look at it from a philosophical perspective. You are telling me, that you don't want to
        start anything more serious with me, as you are not sure whether things will work out or not. - So, you would be
        telling me, that I'm the best I manage to get right now. If you aren't permanently committed, you are committed
        impermanently, temporarily so to speak, and is that the foundation you want? Those couples don't want anything
        serious, because they hope for a bigger fish to catch, they stay together and don't commit with a vow, if
        someone better comes along, they want to have an opened door - just in case. This couple is pathetic. They are
        going to claim that they don't need a piece of paper, reducing marriage to a piece of paper and that they love
        each other. What kind of sweet lie that is, you have no clue whether you can trust or love yourself and you seem
        to know yourself, and you think that you will be able to stay together when the first problems emerge? I'm not
        so sure about that. What nonsense! </p>

    <p><strong><em>No marriage in sight?</em></strong> If you don't intend on getting married in the first place, don't
        be together, it's pointless. Find someone who is better suited for you. </p>

    <p><strong><em>We don't live in 1850, now you can be loose.</em></strong> Self-evident in my opinion that this is
        not true. Self-evident to be true from the perspective of every wise person. People don't change across
        centuries. </p>

    <p><strong>Be strict in the choice of your man.<em> Accepting flaws will lead to resentment, which is going to grow
                over time. I would be very careful with the decision which man to take. </em></strong></p>

    <p><strong><em>I will give you my youth and you give me a less trustworthy husband.</em></strong> I hope I don't
        have to clarify that you never should live together with men who you are not in a relationship with. If you were
        to live together with your boyfriend, the trade is not fair on your side. If you do that, you are going to do a
        lot more in the household, and give him your youth for nothing, he will be more likely to cheat. I don't the
        exact numbers, but you wouldn't be surprised if I told you he was 4 times as likely to. Status, money, and
        resources increase over time, that's what you want in a man, but your beauty and feminity deteriorate over time,
        especially if you are a German woman and eat Brötchen for breakfast and dinner. To counter this imbalance, you
        must marry and take it seriously. Otherwise, he will be tempted to leave you the moment you turn 30 and he
        becomes a millionaire. Then you will be left with nothing except age and lose your feminine energy because of
        that. If you are part of the mad 5%, you probably thought “Well isn't marriage a tool of the patriarchy to take
        advantage of women”, I have to warn you are better off leaving the thinking part to your man! With those kinds
        of beliefs, you will get humbled with 35 to a point where you might never recover. You would be not only naïve
        but also in your ideologically infested bubble. Welcome to being taken advantage of. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Changing her/him while we aren't married.</em></strong> What do you think am I attempting with this
        text, and how well do you think it works? It only works if you are willing to look stupid and contradict modern
        culture's hedonistic doctrine. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Marriage as a vow - fix your problems or die, I'm stuck with you.</em></strong> You are no saint.
        Perhaps you have some sadistic tendencies, some weird repressed sexual fantasies, deep hidden childhood trauma,
        trust and attachment issues, a curvy-back mentality, and countless other problems, especially if you don't dare
        to look at the uncomfortable darkness of your shadow and refuse to incorporate it. Perhaps you also cultivated a
        collection of bad habits that drag you down. Perhaps you've become fat and you lost attraction to each other.
        Maybe you started to deteriorate because you lost the will to live, or maybe you've started to drink out of
        nothing, despite your life being free of traumas and scars. Perhaps you have remaining damage caused by your
        absent or brutally incompetent father. Maybe you get depressed out of nothing, which happens sometimes. Maybe
        you lost your job. Now what? You can't know what's going to surface in 5 years from now unless it already did. I
        was able to remove every trauma of mine in April 2023 and now it seems ridiculous that I had some in the first
        place, I entirely forgot how they feel. Still, life has significantly more to throw at one than just traumas and
        events that cause it. Life will throw everything at you it can throw. What if you or I should develop an
        addiction 10 years from now, despite having immense self-control as of today? Most likely I won't become
        abusive, but what if I do, I can't know for sure. I have the self-awareness to admit that I don't know how I'm
        going to think when I'm 36 and not 16. It's tempting to think that you and your partner are going to just linger
        around in this paradisical comfort you are used to while cohabiting for example. Nothing happens and everything
        stays the way it is, how sweet to live such a life! - Until of course a problem emerges out of nothing. What
        then? - Well, then you're in bloody chaos. So, what then? If you are in darkness, in chaos so to speak, you need
        someone who you can trust your life to, someone who just won't leave you. Only when that happens, will you be
        able to improve and fix problems. “I'm stuck with you, so you have to resolve your problems.” You need enough
        pressure and heat to transmute and you need a container, marriage, to do so, something that makes it impossible
        to escape for you and the heat. The state, the church, your collective of friends, your relatives, they shall
        push both of you together, because you alone won't be able to. You need this pressure from the external. If you
        have a problem, you better fight fast and not wait for 2 years for it to get substantially worse while other
        problems emerge on the side and become worse as well. If this pressure, that results from marriage, if one views
        it as an oath, didn't exist, your partner would leave and your problems would stay and deteriorate you. This
        bond of course can backfire if you take a degenerated person, such as a high school dropout. If one is too
        stupid to handle school, how is this person supposed to handle life and if this person is not afraid to let down
        his entire bloodline by being too incompetent to study the bare minimum, it's hopeless to fix these people. When
        you start to interest yourself in psychology, you will start to learn that most people are not worthy of
        anything and have given up on life a long time ago and just degenerate over time. Step by step, they lose their
        health, wealth, time, energy, beauty, intelligence, and integrity and just linger around declining and living
        shallow, inauthentic, and pathetic lives. Those people will destroy you if you were to marry them, marriage is a
        vow. So, if you know that you are good and that the other person is no loser, you would both benefit from
        someone who you know would not turn a back on, no matter what, and put enough heat and pressure on you for you
        to fix your problems. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Discipline, boundaries, and faith.</em></strong> If you are married, there is always a lot of
        certainty - remember, you will not leave each other, no matter what, at least that's how it's supposed to be. If
        you aren't supposed to leave, it is necessary to establish clear boundaries. If you agree that you as the woman
        aren't allowed to talk to other men and that your man isn't allowed to look at another woman's ass, you add
        faith that it won't happen. From my experience, I know that removing the possibility of failure establishes the
        certainty of success. There is an anecdote for that. A general landed at the enemy's shore and decided to burn
        the ships that got them there. Now everyone knew that they had to win and could not lose. This adds certainty
        beyond what is expected to a point where it almost brings relief. Sometimes in life, you throw dice, and you
        don't know which number it's going to land, you just know that it has to land a six. No matter what math tells
        us here, it just has to. If you know that you are stuck with your partner and eliminate the points at which it
        could fail, by establishing clear and immoveable boundaries, categorical so to speak, communicate straight, and
        resolve the problems you may have, you build a very solid foundation. Magnitudes ahead than the foundation that
        is the result of “marriage is just a piece of paper”, which is no foundation at all. This discipline which is
        established via a solid foundation creates faith. Some pragmatic realists may respond to that as faith is a
        substitute for evidence to swallow supposed truths no sane person should believe in. But that's wrong to a point
        where there is a good quote for, “Some people read Brother's Karamazov, others didn't.” You don't have the
        evidence whether your partner is the right one and you never will. That's where pure reason reaches a plateau
        and empiricism becomes completely useless, until death, you will not know which partner was the right one and
        whether your partner was faithful. Now, you do empirics not work here? Simply because life can be repeated like
        a fancy chemical being mixed. You must put in the faith by getting married! That's the only way. Death defeats
        time.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Irony of fate.</em></strong> I live and demons hunt me until I write to release them and transmute
        into angles. A strong desire generates and resisting it makes me depressed, I'm destined to think thoughts about
        what keeps the world together. You could also call these demons angels, but only if the demons go away.
        Contrastingly, most people aren't possessed and just live and accept life as being full of mystery and miracles.
        A teacher once told me, that she knew a couple who cohabited for 10 years, got married, and got divorced a few
        months later. She also told me that she knew a couple who got married after 3 days and stayed together forever.
        Knowing what you know now, it seems that this is how it should be. You can't simulate what it feels like to be
        tied to a person for the rest of your life. Call it destiny until you know what it is. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Marriage costs money.</em></strong> No, the piece of paper costs very little money, in Germany 65€.
        Marry fast and young and have the wedding a lot later, if you want to. Wedding and marriage are two different
        words and things, it's easy to ignore them. Now I'm going to use your way of arguing, you need the piece of
        paper as a mental foundation, but the ring can wait until you stop being a broke student. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Why I want to get married young.</em></strong> I want to do something most people don't dare to do,
        which is to establish something and do something with one's life. If you have a partner who believes more in you
        than you do, you will live an amazing life, and no life area will lower in its area if you have the right
        partner. For this, look at someone's flaws. I'm judgmental. Some women will see this as indifferent or even
        amusing. I don't want to be a peasant, I view myself as great, and every day I prove it to myself. Some women
        will find ambition sexy. I believe in angels, demons, zombies (#104), and other stuff. Some women will be out
        there who agree. If you considered every flaw, and they align, you moved a lot closer to the right one. The next
        thing on the checklist is whether the energies, goals… and other stuff align. Furthermore, you have to
        differentiate between growing and changing. Growing would be more of oneself, for example, more sports and
        greater texts, while changing would be to get a fat loser who isn't judgmental in the slightest. If your partner
        likes you for, being you, you can continue to grow even faster. You marry twice, right now and then the person
        she/he is going to become. If both match, everything will work out. It adds a lot of certainty, which allows you
        to excel in every other area.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Marry young.</em></strong> If you marry young, you will still be able to change the behaviors of that
        person far more easily than you would be able to, if you were to meet him at 25. I don't say it's easy, you see
        yourself how hard it is to change. When your personalities have established themselves and stabilized themselves
        due to time and decreasing neuroplasticity, it's much harder to merge. I will bring a very pragmatic line here.
        If your husband is 50 and lives by the motto, “I saw. I came. I crumbled the kitchen to the annoyance of my
        wife.”, good luck trying to fix him. It's simply not going to work and more pressure and heat may not make it
        either. Also, you don't know how this person is going to turn out to be after 20 years anyway, you don't even
        know it yourself. How fast you should marry is a trivial question. At least one week after meeting each other
        the absolute maximum being two years. Generally, every love story is unique. Hesitation makes things a lot
        worse. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Divorce.</em></strong> Divorce is not real. Divorce is as little of a real concept as depression or
        being ugly. Sure, if you're a depressed collection of bad habits, you will be ugly. And if you live wrong, you
        will be depressed. Those things do exist, but they are nothing you are at nature's mercy to. You can get
        divorced, but it will ruin you and your partner likewise. It will not only end up with one or both of you a lot
        worse than you started but also inflict serious damage on your children if you had those. I admit, that this is
        sometimes less painful than being with a degenerated person.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Sex before marriage is a bad idea.</em></strong> If you are reading and living together and having
        sex while not being married, get married on the spot or stop doing so. Otherwise, you will get divorced pretty
        much for sure. If you don't want religious dogma, read any scientific paper on this subject. Outside of
        seemingly balanced opinions, the evidence is clear and you can't revoke it, regardless of your will. The first
        argument comes from observing antisocial behavioral patterns. All promiscuous people are antisocial to a higher
        degree, that's also why many of them are successful in the material sense. If one establishes asocial behavioral
        patterns, one starts to view people as a means to an end and antisocial behavior also predicts a parasitical,
        impulsive, irresponsible, egoistic hedonism that transcends the person's entire life. Now, someone who is or was
        promiscuous has some strongly developed antisocial tendencies, certainly, that should be a reason for future
        marriages to break apart. However, no one has found a sufficient theory that explains this phenomenon
        scientifically, therefore, we must return to philosophical, religious, and common-sense interpretations of why
        sex before marriage is a bad idea. Also, I think you aren't that antisocial, but the antisocial argument isn't,
        I fear, too far-fetched. People who live with this careless attitude tend to find life meaningless… The main
        argument against having fun as a couple is the aspect of purity, if you aren't sure you're going to marry this
        person, why risk it? Casual sex is never good, but just as horrible as having ten partners. Each new bond
        weakens. If you plan on getting married, it's not a lot better, if you know anything about relationships. The
        raw attraction fades almost entirely after 6 months and you are being put to the first test, whether you like
        each other by your personalities or simply because it was interesting to talk together. If it turns out, that
        you don't fit together at all, it will reveal itself decently faster and you can try to find someone new with
        much less damage and a much easier breakup. However, being a monkey will make the initial delay phase last up to
        5 years. If you then notice that you truly aren't made for each other, it's catastrophically. If you overcome
        this initial attraction and realize that you found someone for life, you have not only proven that you like
        him/her as a person and not because of a toy or status object, but also established further discipline, as you
        are going to know that hard times may come and you would already know much better how to handle those. First,
        cross the desert. So, it's either destructive instant gratification or an elevating but delayed one.</p>

    <p>I wanted to point out that I desperately tried to find counterarguments and I talked to a bunch of people and
        read many articles online. What I noticed in the more 'balanced' opinions is a logical flaw, it always assumes
        that the couple will have sex indefinitely or break up if the sex isn't great. Look at your parents. Is that
        true? Or is it rather always the case that couples need to pass the test of time with discipline and free of
        gratification? </p>

    <p>My older texts have another very important message in them. How you do one thing reveals everything you need to
        know about a person. If one cheats on tests, he will cheat in life. If one does not need God to look over one,
        one is not worthy of trust. If one gambles, one will be reckless with his health too. If one wastes his time on
        social media, so will one not be able to find time for what is meaningful. If you decide to go on a trip with
        your boyfriend and decide to have sex in a car with him, I do not doubt that you view your entire life rather
        careless. Consequently, you will be too weak to pass the test of time, and your careless and laid-back attitude
        will not be free of cost. </p>

    <p><strong><em>The marriage's priority.</em></strong> Certainly not discussing who is going to pick up the children
        from kindergarten. But what then? Maybe trust, respect, open communication, common goals, passion…? Why should
        that be true? Think harder. What is at the core of a romantic relationship - let me give you a tip, it's not
        friendship, it's attraction and passion. Without raw attraction, you get the couple that starts to resent each
        other because of some half-offensive joke made 10 years ago. Perhaps no one taught you anything, the answer may
        repel a lot of people at first glance, but sex is the priority. “Aren't children more important?” If you care
        about your children so much, don't take the beta male you will stop liking after 5 years and make sure you as
        the parents love each other. Sex is the foundation for a romantic relationship, that's why casual sex is not
        allowed. What sort of trust is there, if you don't dare to see each naked? Your children are going to suffer if
        their parents don't like each other anymore, don't trust each other, and aren't attracted to each other. That's
        when you get the weak son and the broken daughter, what is their world going to look like, if their parents
        don't like each other? That's part of the reason why having children at the age of 35 is horrible for them. You
        shouldn't forget what you came together in the first place for, I doubt that you started to love each other to
        then discuss random chores. What's important to point out here as well is that only the loser couple stops
        having sex after getting married, most couples have far more sex than singles. This misbelief is one of the
        causes why many young people believe in hedonism, they think that all married couples stop having sex because
        their assertive mother and beta father do. This is not correct if you have a superior woman and man together,
        who will have unbelievable attraction towards each other. Marriage is about giving up yourself and merging with
        the other person. Concepts like 'clear communication' become irrelevant - Ever desireless? No ever rightless. In
        marriage you become one person, and the most effective way to merge as a person is to have sex, which allows you
        to open yourself. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Opening yourself.</em></strong> There is a lot inside of you. You can let it all out if you find the
        right partner. Love is making oneself vulnerable, and opening oneself is only possible with the right person. If
        you open yourself to the degenerate, you will have trouble, but you still can - you can trust him, you can love
        him, you can cook for him, it's just that I will destroy you. You must find someone who you can open yourself to
        and then love, trust, and cook for him. This will make it possible for you to release your energy without any
        danger.</p>

    <p>What about the complementary opposite? - You become one person in marriage to prosper together, which is
        certainly not easy, but ultimately worth it. There will be moments where you will hate your partner more than
        anything and would wish for them to never have existed, but trust me, you want to hate them ten thousand times
        rather than one. It's worth it in the end.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Love so passionate, it's unbelievable.</em></strong> Married. Now what? Live with the fear of his
        complacency and your growing resentment due to his slow decline of integrity? Will you stop having sex and your
        parent's critique of this text for being overly idealistic will turn out to be correct? Maybe, the choice is
        yours. But this doesn't have to happen with the right one. For example, I'm capable of loving passionately and I
        feel attraction towards certain women it's unbelievable to most. How so? I'm a very extreme person and that’s
        what unleashes strong energies, that enable me to love passionately, the differences between me and a feminine
        woman are large. Couples get bored of each other if their energies become too similar. For example, it may have
        started that you were the princess and he was the warrior. Slowly, you became a woman who makes phone calls and
        he became the one who sees, comes, and crumbles the kitchen to your annoyance. Both of you got a downgrade so to
        speak, the alpha male morphed into an ordinary beta because his life got too easy. And because he stopped trying
        hard, you don't try hard either and grow complacent as well. This loss of attraction happens automatically, and
        that's also what I described in the paragraphs of 'Sex before marriage is not a good idea'. Usually, it takes
        around 6 months for the initial attraction to fade, and for the couple to become fully depolarized can take
        around 5 years. Depolarization means, that extremely different sexual energies start to morph, i.e. the couple
        becomes too similar. I find it a pity that most people's energies are too similar for them to have such
        experiences (#99), they are, it seems, genderless worms rather than men and women, depolarized from the very
        beginning. This depolarized couple can talk about hobbies and their romance is rather friendship. I don’t think
        you want that. </p>

    <p>Certainly, there are couples where the man has feminine energy and the woman is masculine but those couples are
        not too common, I know that if I have feminine energy I lie in bed with a horrible depression because it feels
        so inauthentic, too distanced from my core. Generally, gender and polarity match.</p>

    <p>A polarized. couple may have a pillow fight and then kiss passionately or they may scream at each other and then
        look each other in the eyes and feel attraction so strong they end up making love on the spot as well.
        Fortunately, there is a lot you can do to maintain this polarity or even grow it and it's not hard and doesn't
        take much time either.</p>

    <p><em>“So how do you be more feminine? It's fairly simple. Be careful, sweet, dress accordingly, have good manners,
            be polite, spend more time with feminine women, be less aggressive, and be more loving. Though, don't
            exaggerate with empathy. Likewise, you must learn that you need to sit with your shoulders back just like
            every man would do it and chances are you aren't doing it right now. Embrace your emotions, put the
            responsibility onto others, and relax while learning how to be the biggest fan of your man. Put love in
            everything you do.” - text #99</em></p>

    <p>I want to give you an example. I know someone who planned a trip to Paris and Marseille with his girlfriend at
        the time between the end of 12th grade and the beginning of university. To test how feminine you are, ask
        yourself: If you told your man that you wanted to go there implicitly a couple of times and one day you came to
        visit him, and he said, 'Pack your stuff, you have one hour, everything is taken care of' would you get excited?
    </p>

    <p>How to become more masculine is a bit more difficult and not the subject of this text. Generally, becoming more
        masculine is similar to becoming the alpha male, but it doesn't have to be. The most important aspect of the
        spiritually living masculine is to stay to one's core. Someone who lies on the sofa does not live true to one's
        core. That means, the alpha male can be not spiritually masculine and some random broke artist can be, in which
        case the random broke artist would be a better lover. But, I have to make something clear regarding every
        spiritual teaching and only they can understand what I'm talking about. I know that this is a manipulation
        tactic, but it doesn't make it wrong. The mindless club girl has no idea and neither will the high school
        dropout be able to even remotely grasp how the hell one can live a life without hedonism and how my supposedly
        boring life is so much fun. Intelligence is defined as the capacity of one's mind in this context. Most people
        are stuck on the monkey level or a bit above. Only intelligent people can comprehend what deep fulfillment means
        in the first place… To resume with the question of how to become more masculine or feminine, there are a lot of
        metaphors in nature. While the feminine moves in every direction, the masculine is the direction. The feminine
        is change, while the masculine is constant. Masculine is consciousness, and feminine are the thoughts that
        drift. The sky and day are masculine, and the earth and night are feminine. Yin is masculine. and yang is
        feminine. Masculine is domination, feminine is submission… Simply read spiritual texts and learn to apply them
        with the help of deep meditation in nature.

    <h1>7. Redemption</h1>

    <p><strong><em>This text is not strict, life is.</em></strong> A lot of people have a common belief which is
        interesting to think about, an answer to the question, who has an easier life, men or women? In this text I make
        it seem as if you as the woman have it hard. There are hedonistic temptations everywhere, false and hostile
        beliefs, manipulators, there is a lot of pressure on you, and it's easy to get your life ruined because of many
        qualities a woman has. As a woman you are weaker, have a complicated body, and have emotions effectively outside
        of your control. Your life is complicated. This has brought me to a very good conclusion as to what constitutes
        a good man; his life has to be significantly harder than yours. He makes your life feel effortless, to phrase it
        differently. Normally one could argue that the world is
        brutal for most men, but this is countered by many forces, especially if you refuse to fight the game of life in
        the first place. The man who is effectively childless, as he never spends time with them and lies on the sofa
        instead has an easy life and that's what makes you unable to feel attraction. However, some men a living like me
        and I know you wouldn't be able to handle my life unless you are forced to, partially because your man isn't a
        tiger but a cute otter, far away from your wet dream. Then there is a category of men who live lives outside of
        the comprehension of the normal person, especially normal women. I think I don't need to elaborate on who has a
        harder life. This kind of man needs tension to have a reason to get out of bed. Most men aren't like that, they
        live more pathetic lives, one where their woman's life is harder. The male world is just as brutal as the female
        one, if you hooked up, you won't get a great husband just as the 12-year-old boy who can't stop biting his nails
        will never become successful and live a life of prosperity. Life is brutal, and to hell with your free will! In
        life, some things are true-ish and things are false-ish, and there is no ideology to it, if you wasted your
        youth being the party girl, there will never be a prince waiting for you, regardless of what you believe to be
        true. Maybe go to that party and think that my text is exaggerated. But you will know with your quieter voice
        which opinion is more true-ish. Maybe you had the high school dropout to your boyfriend. Maybe you've been to a
        few parties. Maybe you've got a tattoo. Maybe you are an awful person to be around and that's the reason all of
        your relationships broke apart. Is it too late? Might be, I don't know. What you must not do is to deny and to
        delude yourself. If you lie to yourself, you aren't helping anyone. You know, a very simple tip. Sit on your bed
        in the middle of the night and think about your life. What are some problems you have that you could fix? You
        may not like the answer, because it's going to be the necessary one. Yes, that's who your life is and that's the
        location of the starting point. If you use this starting point to base your decisions on, you are going to live
        a lot calmer and make more accurate decisions. You can't fix your past, and your past is going to haunt you
        forever. Nonetheless confessing your sins is the first step towards redemption and an improved life. The moment
        you start to accept that no prince is going to pick you up on his white horse and the moment you accept it's
        your fault, that's the moment your brain will start to look for solutions on its own. Ok, if there is no prince
        for me and I know that for sure, what can I do? Regret is a force to better yourself. Many mistakes will be
        forgiven by time itself. Perhaps you turn out lucky and your mistakes become trivial. </p>

    <p><strong><em>I don't think it's too late for you.</em></strong> A bad conscience before all trains have left
        cleans the soul. If the universe is ruled by God on the axiom of justice, the question remains whether you
        deserve a second chance or not. Maybe you do.</p>

    <h1>8. The superior woman</h1>

    <p>What do men look for? It's simple. Everything can be replaced by someone else except peace of mind when he comes
        home. The superior woman is feminine and educated. She listens to her husband while being his #1 fan. The
        superior woman has no problems with resisting hedonism and being decent, warm, and caring, a great mother.
        That's who you want to become and that's what this text is for, to enable you to fully prosper by avoiding
        mistakes and finding a man who is not only 'just as imperfect as you', but 'just as superior as you'. You have
        to ask yourself what you want to get out of life. Do you want beautiful children and a loving husband? I doubt
        you want anything else deep in your heart. <br>Things
        take time.</p>

    <p>Do you want a life of meaningless pleasure or deep enlightenment?</p>


    <p><em>“My favorite emotion is the way the leaves fly in the mildly warm wind of last
            autumn days. That's the emotion you get after having accomplished something and let go, without resistance,
            just in the moment things take their natural course again. The leaves come and go, just as the wind,
            seasons, and the entirety of the seemingly eternal universe. That's what fulfilment feels like and it's
            permanent. This is my favorite emotion and believe it or not, I have tears of joy in my eyes this instant,
            already for the second time, despite having formulated this paragraph twice. There is nothing better than
            working on something for years, exhausting yourself, and then getting a few breaths of peaceful stillness.
            How pleasant would it be to spend such a moment holding hands? Bittersweet piano. It's when every second is
            filled with pain, but the bigger picture is as wonderful as it can be, every stroke of the brush brings
            horror and the result is the prettiest image one can grasp - truly breathtaking - just as the last moment of
            stillness before you know that you are ready for something new and even better, and this new even better
            time is ahead. I wish to see the golden leaves falling from the trees in windy sunshine with you, where the
            sun shines for one of the last times in the year before the dark and cold winter. And I would cite Goethe,

            “Will I say to the moment, just linger, you are so beautiful.”</em><br>- a love letter of mine</p>

    <p>Writing this text brought some real redemption to me, deeper than any meditation. I have long kept these concepts
        in my mind and never dared to write them down. It would be weird if a 14-year-old would have written it,
        wouldn't it? This would raise obvious questions, mainly where all of this knowledge comes from. Now that I'm 16,
        I can tell you where I got the ideas from. From reading, watching competent people on YouTube, life, and talking
        to people. This text can't hide that it seems to be written to the girl who I couldn't get over, i.e. still
        love, a year after having asked her out twice. It sort of is, if we come together, it's nice, if not, I hope she
        quietly implements the lessons and cuts out losers forever. If not, it's her fault and I shouldn't interfere.
        Time is scarce. For most, I kept her in mind as the good girl, which is comforting. May I now come to peace.

    <p>Happy Women's Day 2024. </p>

    <p><br><br><br></p>


    <h1>8.3.2024</h1>

    <p>Text releasing ~today. The date, woman's day is a coincidence. 23322 words, 2 hour reading time. It's going to
        be a valueable one, no matter who you are. </p>

    <h1>7.3.2024</h1>

    <p>One week into March, and I have to sit down and ask myself whether I'm going where I want to go.</p>

    <h1>6.3.2024</h1>

    <p>Seems my character development stuff worked, time to brag! The text is done, ~21000 words, but now I have
        to check it for errors and for inconsistencies.</p>

    <h1>5.3.2024</h1>

    <p>It's in my interest to say the math competition in Dresden didn't go so well. Fun it was. Especially because I
        was the only one without a curvy back from the other 12th graders. The text is now 20,000 words long.</p>

    <h1>4.3.2024</h1>

    <p>I'm at an unexpected blissful peace. I guess I'm getting old. The text may be too large and I consider
        splitting it into 3, but the key message persists and is revealed towards the start of the last third. The text
        is called "How to be a good girl", but, I bet you will be surprised when you then start to read. </p>

    <p>Not writing until the day over tomorrow to gain new inspiration.</p>

    <p>Today, after a workout as brutal as I didn't have in while, I went on my daily walk. From 17:17 - 18:05, I ran
        10km ± 300 m, i.e. 12.5km/h, I ran to the lake along the river, around the lake and then back. I'm proud,
        because that was right after the brutal workout and I ran strong, some sections with 15km/h for two minutes,
        especially towards the end.</p>

    <p>Today I decided something and this decision has nothing to do with the girl. Normal people aren't grateful, and
        that makes them suffer. The influencer kind of personality has a notebook to write down things one is grateful
        for. But being grateful for everything makes one complacent. There is no reason to get out of bed if you are
        completely happy with your life. Instead of being grateful for everything, I should train myself to look at
        things I hate about my life. For example. What do I need to be happy for, if I'm still making 0€/month?
        <em>Golden middle.</em>

    <h1>3.3.2024</h1>

    <p>Broke the 15000-word mark with this draft. I think it's a very powerful text, I will release it on Wednesday or
        so.</p>

    <h1>2.3.2024</h1>

    <p>Yesterday I wrote the first 5000 words of the text as to how to be a good girl. The title may discard the
        underlying complexity, I think it's a very powerful, deep and dark text. I get a lot of fun writing it, as it
        allows me to process a lot. For example, in the texts I describe in 700 words what the life with the average man
        feels like or on 2000 words I describe what all girls dream about and don't want to admit it. The current third
        of the text which is done is very painful, judgmental and insulting, so I will need to fix that.</p>

    <p>Went on a run through the mountains today and it was pretty.</p>

    <p>As I'm writing this text further, I notice how many of my beliefs are inverting. My character development seems
        to
        stabilize. </p>
