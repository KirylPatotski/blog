  <h1>Laying a solid foundation</h1>

  <p>My first idea, it's dead, I'm free. It died in September, in The Final Battle, spectacularly. Now, what do I do?
    Will there be anything worth writing about, my diary has been emptier recently. It's all right, I won't run out of
    content to write about. I barely scratch the surface and some interesting stories only get told months later or
    appear as fragments in bigger ones. Most of them are never told. </p>

  <p>In the next few months, a lot of irrelevant noise is going to come into my life and there is nothing I can do about
    it, even if I despise it. I don't want to learn how to drive, but that's another story.</p>

  <p>I wrote in my diary, in mid-September, 3 months after “18.6” that I felt a decline after an amazing time and that's
    all right because I know I will recover fast. The last 2 weeks were not very full. I got weak again. I started to
    listen to music, I ate sugar, I missed getting up at 5 many times, I didn't record YouTube videos even though I knew
    I should have, I didn't go to the gym every day… </p>

  <p>It's the first of October 2023, and I am reflecting on what just happened, I lived the perfect life for 6 months
    now. (Perfect without “) When I think about the best month of the year so far, I can't answer it. Simply too much
    happened, and most of it will be forever lost. For example, the 50 failures that contributed to my decline in June.
    Does it matter that I got slapped in the face that often? Not really. What matters, is that the best times were the
    ones where I worked the hardest. There were always things corrupting the time, but most of it was well spent, on my
    work. Those are therefore the results I have gotten. </p>

  <p>But I become weaker. Suddenly, when I am about to record a video, I procrastinate, because I'm too scared, that if
    I don't procrastinate, become fearless and hard working I will burn out again, have nothing to do, and suffer
    mentally. </p>

  <p>How do I get rid of that fear? That's what this text is about.</p>

  <p>I think I already know all of the answers to most of my problems, a paradox of sentences. I will fix it with the
    following measures. Those are ultra-specific measures, that's why this text is so new. I think you are familiar with
    the situation of slow decline after a few amazing months.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>I will write down things I learned or done in my progress tracker right away instead of waiting till the
      evening, or the next day, which is even worse. If I write things down right away, I will accomplish and learn more
      in general. Often, tasks with immense return on investment are easy and short. It takes 5 minutes a day to learn
      how to speak with excellence, yet if you don't write down these little tasks and short tasks, you will have less
      incentive to do them. But, if you write them down right away, you will feel rewarded. Writing them down stores
      your actions forever in the physical realm, and gives you confidence in the process. Part of my immense progress
      in the Spring of 2023 was this chasing of writing down things, simple and easy ones, that I have done. I could
      fill 4 lines per day with: “Practiced speech”, “Got 3 new ideas for my business”, read “15 pages of that book” and
      “meditated 3 times, 45 minutes altogether” </li>

    <li>Every day I go to the gym and for a 2-hour walk right after. Every day I meditate at
      15:00, and every day I get up at 5. If your day is structured, no time is lost in between, micro moments are saved
      and at the same time, more time for good habits is included automatically. Furthermore, your mental capacity isn't
      reduced, because you already know what to do next. But a schedule isn't enough and neither is a to-do list or
      simply a grand goal. I could easily avoid to-do lists because it was clear to me what I would do the next day, but
      at these times I mostly spend my days programming, while now I spend most of my time on these blogs and YouTube.
      But there is a slight problem with that. Recording a YouTube video is mentally and emotionally extremely costly,
      in comparison to programming, and the preparation time and pressure are much greater too. While programming I
      simply opened the program and started. But if I want to record a video, I have to meditate, make my hair, warm up
      my voice, dress up… read the text multiple times over, and maybe also speak it through. This takes up a huge
      amount of mental capacity, therefore it feels exhausting and I try to avoid it. Because I excel at programming, I
      find it fun, but because I have not mastered YouTube, I don't enjoy it. That's why the next measure I will take is
      to write down which video I will record on what day. I need this to keep myself accountable. <em>Deadlines
      accelerate.</em> </li>

    <li>Driving school will occupy 5 hours per week, altogether around 70 hours. These 70 hours include the time it
      takes to get there, to be there, and to come back home, meaning also the micro-moments in between. 70 hours is a
      lot of time, of otherwise productive time…
      Also, I will need to learn how to handle having no singular main project to work on, since my first app just died
      and my other ones need their time. YouTube will never be my top priority, because the content for YouTube stems
      from my life.
    </li>

    <li>Going back to the main theme of writing everything down to keep myself accountable and to accomplish more in
      general, especially the smaller, yet significant tasks, I will add a new task to commit to every day: reading in
      Russian and reading aloud poetry in Russian. 5 minutes a day should already do wonders.</li>

    <li>I know how to get rid of all bad habits, and that is by making them harder. For 6 months I didn't have any bad
      habits, I complained on a high level previously, but before that computer games didn't addict me, because they
      took a long to load. If a game takes 5 minutes to open, there are a lot of opportunities to go back and quit. On
      the other hand, YouTube takes no more than 15 seconds to open. That's what I will use in my favor: I will not
      collapse my tripod and put my camera on the shelf on the day I'm supposed to record something. Neither will I turn
      off my computer, I should have no excuse to start my day at 5 with productivity.</li>

  </ol>

  <p>I believe that these measures will remove the fear of too fast progress again and I will regain immense
    productivity. All with the help of my diary, as I call it, my progress tracker. <em>These little tasks will lay a solid
    foundation</em>.</p>
