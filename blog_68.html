    <h1>The Second Try</h1>

    <p>On the last August day, I went in summer dusk for the last summer walk of this year. The clouds weren't golden
        tinted as in every one of my last adventures they were grey and slowly morphed into a saturated magenta and the
        sky was already fading black, the wind got motionless and it got silent. I sat down on a bench and looked at the
        scenery. At this moment, <a href="blog_65.html">God</a> decided to strike me with a brilliant idea. </p>

    <p>At the time of the conceptualization of this new idea, my first app had already a  <a href="blog_64.html">destined fate</a>, and it would
        take a few more days for this app to reach its end as my first entrepreneurial try and something that has shaped
        my last years of mine. This journey had brought me far and I was ready for something new. </p>

    <p>The idea, that I got would dictate an entire week and the idea goes the following. I already have plenty of
        expertise in app creation and I already constructed 3 apps, while the first one died now, the next logical step
        would be to chop the next idea, to verify its integrity. My second app was a mental math and memory app for
        seniors and the idea was to create a radically new app: one that would transcend into every area of the journey
        of seniors. It would include everything, from math, and memory, to games, which already exist, and sports. </p>

    <h1>1. Where you come from and where you go</h1>

    <p>The first idea isn't the final one, the first desire is never the one to be fulfilled first. I got to walk for
        about one more hour and got creative. A new app, for what? I constructed a solid app already, so I could reuse
        some components of it, or maybe just the designs and systems? Why should I create a completely new app in the
        first place, rather than extending my completed app? I could reuse my designs and systems regardless and save a
        lot of time, but will this sacrifice new potential lessons?</p>

    <p>I have had enough. I looked at where I came from, and what I have done, I looked at my designs and decided to
        stick to them. Reinventing myself would be impractical, this would conflict with where I came from, and with
        everything I have ever done. It doesn't make sense to try out a new design style or to create a new app if an
        existing one already does its job flawlessly. In the tree of decisions, every path can be viewed as a curved
        copper wire. How would you straighten a cable? You would drag it along a sharp surface or use pliers instead. If
        your pliers are bigger, it will be effortless to straighten the cable. The same thing applies here. If you need
        to build something new, you need to orient yourself to existing principles, to make everything more effortless
        and easier. Only when you reach the end of the cable, you will be free and able to try out completely new ways.
    </p>

    <p>Coming up with systems for exercises, workouts, plans, descriptions, texts, pictures, data, and recommendations
        was no easy task and everything had to be thought through. But I (the sharp edge or the pliers) was constantly
        looking at my progress with the construction and derived from it what would need to be modified next. This is
        the same principle used by smiths hammering a redly glowing piece of steel surrounded by smoke and little sparks
        to eventually make a sword out of it. The smith doesn't take a new piece of iron with every hammer beat, instead
        the smith <em>remembers where he came from and where he was going</em> and continues to edit this piece of steel until
        it turns into a majestical sword. After he was done, he polished the sword and started all over again but never
        forgot the lessons, and <em>where he came from</em>. Like this, he never lost focus and perspective as the known path
        leads to a specific outcome with lightly fluctuating certainty.</p>

    <p>I never lost focus either, because I knew, that I would be able to deliver a great product if I remembered why I
        started and used this insight as a starting point again. What would I need to do next? Well, that's my goal, so…
    </p>

    <h1>2. The ultimate challenge</h1>

    <p>Right at the beginning of the new idea I was made aware that this idea would leverage every skill I have acquired
        so far. Video editing, working out, programming, designing, writing, communicating, and every skill I got in
        possession of on the side, such as the right work ethic or fear management.</p>

    <p>I spent a week building the foundation and then I got to the <a href="blog_50.html">“scariest”</a> part - the part with the highest return
        on investment. I took my desk and moved it to the window on Thursday, revealing plenty of space *in my room* and
        took out my camera and wanted to start recording demonstrations of the exercises. God played in my favor, I
        recorded myself completing pushups and I thought that the recordings were excellent, but reality told me
        otherwise, <em>my hair</em> was too long and therefore not optimal. Considering I would be going to the hairdresser
        tomorrow, I stopped and sat myself down at the desk and made some final adjustments to the systems, layouts, and
        designs, polishing the sword. Then it turned Friday and the minute I came home from the hairdresser I turned the
        already positioned camera on and recorded 25 exercises in 15 minutes. I edited them and inserted the resulting
        motion images into the app and I was almost done… On the next day, I worked on the designs, and layouts as well
        as some testing and final adjustments. I could have published the app yesterday or a few days ago but I
        deliberately decided against it.</p>

    <h1>3. More, Better, New</h1>

    <p>In the beginning, it doesn't matter how the world displays you. If your videos get no views, it doesn't mean they
        are bad inevitably, and there is only one way to counteract this unfavorable outcome: create products so great,
        that people will share them with enthusiasm. I could have stopped with math and memory and made them better, by
        remembering where I came from and where I was going with them, instead, I decided to add something new to my
        app: sports. By doing so, I went <a href="blog_43.html">above and beyond</a>, meaning the user should get the best possible experience,
        even if that delays progress. What is something half-done worth in comparison to something that went <em>above and
        beyond</em>? </p>

    <p>I started to go to them in February of 2023 and I never made any rest days, except for Sunday. In the same manner, I
    never made rest days in my entrepreneurial journey, I continued to build competence (=hard skills) and was
    constantly doing more and more - until my unexpected <a href="blog_50.html">burnout</a> in June, which made me focus on <em>better</em> instead.</p>

    <p>Finally, if my 2nd and 3rd apps fail as well, I will enter the <em>new</em> phase.</p>
