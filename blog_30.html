    <h1>Remove micro moments</h1>

    <p>For the, at the time not too rare occasion of doubt, both external and internal, as well as the recommendation
        contained in a book, I started to write down a report of every day of my life ever since; I started on April
        2nd, 2023. Every day I would write down every significant task I completed/started/resumed that would make me
        financially free, …</p>

    <p>As recently as March 2023 I was still watching YouTube, a direct distraction. But the daily review of the
        progress was there to hold myself accountable. Accountability is the character trait you need to take control of
        your life, therefore writing a diary <em>is taking control of your life</em>. Because I got accountable, I
        started to pressure myself, and - I got such immense results. </p>

    <p>But this wasn't the first time I regularly wrote a diary, as a matter of fact in 2019 I wrote 2 pages per day
        (yes, I myself don't know how I was able to do it) for around 60 days. I used to write diary before I went to
        bed, as I have written it down back then. I also knew the benefits of doing so at that point in time, when I was
        12. There was an event, which made me quit, a party. (Maybe that's why I don't like parties) Because I was 12 my
        writings were mildly unsophisticated and my font made it impossible to read what the hell I have written. </p>

    <p>This essay is not intended to be about writing diaries, even though the title may suggest. This essay is about
        out-competing 5 people as an individual or completing a week's work in a day, for the rest of your existence,
        where writing a diary had a key role in helping with this.</p>

    <p>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Before you get started, you need to make your life perfect. You need to fix your life until perfection. I wrote
        yesterday's blog “Stay away from me” in one sitting, from 5:30 - 10:30, 3200 words, because I had the mental
        capacity, health, and IQ to do so. In fact, my lifestyle changes, such as getting up at 5 or taking cold showers
        led to an IQ increase of around 30 points in just 1 year. You will experience similar changes. </p>

    <p>Actually, it took 39 (=7 + 7 + 8 + 17) minutes to speak every video, for some reason, I needed 2 hours. This is
        exactly where writing a diary helps because it removes this friction. Instead of you procrastinating in front of
        a 5-minute task and thinking about it all day long, you simply do it. Look, why is it that some people can do
        genuinely nothing and others outperform 10 people? Obviously, how much order in your life and how good your
        health is matter extremely, but not less important are micro-moments that you waste. Imagine how many 5-minute
        tasks, with high leverage, you could do in a day. Probably 0. But now if you remove any procrastination and
        wasted micro-moments, you could easily do 10. </p>

    <p>Essentially, micro moments are moments of such little value, that your conscious mind doesn't even fathom them.
        Micro-moments are you looking at your clock, which I find to be morally wrong btw., out of the window, at your
        email program, or maybe at your desk and the bed you have not made? Maybe you have not advanced and your
        micro-moments are quite significant, for example looking at your phone, or even using the internet to look up a
        random thought that got into your mind. Maybe you are saying to yourself: “just this song, then I'll start to do
        something” or you simply procrastinate and wonder why you genuinely completed nothing that day. </p>

    <p>Every eleventh grader needed to write something called “KL” which is an 8 paged paper about anything scientific.
        While everyone complained about how little time they had (just 6 months) I wrote mine in one sitting in 4 hours
        about Android development. This was in October 2022, before I started going to the gym or ChatGPT existed or I
        did anything on a great scale, like getting up at 5. In March 2023 I was able to write a 25 paged paper in 2
        sittings (about my entrepreneurial journey, and also for school) </p>

    <p>The proper way to focus, which removes these micro-moments, is to refuse to physically look away from the work,
        every time you look away, you lose 5 minutes. Remove distractions as well, it may help you to use airplane mode.
        Also, get up at 5 and start with the hardest task, because once you start doing it, you will forget what you
        were scared of in the first place. </p>

    <p>It will take a while for you to perfect your life, for me it took 2 years, and as I tried harder, around 3
        months. In May I reached a point, where 70% of days looked like straight out of a motivational book, just what I
        have described here. It had its negative side effects: As my experience, knowledge, and lifestyle started to get
        even better, everything collapsed in June, at first emotionally (1-7) and then I got to a point where I simply
        couldn't perform (19-31). I simply ran out of these “scary”, meaningful tasks because I moved too quickly. </p>

    <p><em>You may be tempted to think</em>, that this existence of constant performance is kind of sad. I do acknowledge, I
        would have thought the same, if I was less advanced. But this is the only way to live. Let's suppose you get
        rich and successful and influential. Buying a new house or getting a 3-second 12-year-old's glance at your car
        will become meaningless after like 5 days. What remains after this point? Trying your absolute best does. Having
        a perfect life provides joy.</p>
