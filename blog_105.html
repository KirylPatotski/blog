    <h1>Your children don't love you</h1>

    <p><em><strong>A critique of pragmatic thought.</strong></em>
        Learn from text and not from regret. I guarantee that you are better off thinking less pragmatically, especially
        considering that pragmatism establishes itself down the river of time. Pragmatism is a reactionary attempt to
        “stay practical” and it is shaped by experience. Hence, you may be tempted to think that there is more to life
        than simply spirituality, yet you must conclude that there is only one thing in this universe, and it's the
        mind. It's easy to slip back into a pragmatic way of thinking, yet it will destroy you and suck out the meaning
        of your life. It will make you sink into the irrelevance of everyday life. You do not want to be the person that
        lives alienated at the age of 40, because you've learned it too late and considered yourself to be “smart.” You
        can't wish to desire a life of regret, since regret is permanent, and you can't wish to want to miss the love of
        your children. Yet, likely you are heading this way, I know the people around me and they position themselves
        rather uncomfortably. They all think that humans aren't beings of love, but rather meaningless creatures - and
        that's the life they are living. They claim that metaphysics (everything that can't be measured) is nonsense,
        yet every person sooner or later comes to the conclusion that everything spiritual people teach approaches
        reality with razor-sharp precision. Yet, every lesson spiritual people give is purely idealistic, not pragmatic
        and they are happier.</p>

    <p>The alternative to a spiritual way of life is living a meaningless life, one where your children won't love you,
        if you even 'decide' to have some and aren't sunken into your career. Most people I know are heading towards a
        life where they have a career and find having children immoral. Visualize how that life looks once you approach
        50 and find that you've wasted your life. You've picked a career that you've probably resented, just to make
        some money, of which you have little left? You are completely alone and wonder why you don't have the energy to
        get up in the morning. You live the life of an archetypical loser, but of course, at least you felt to be
        rational your entire life and you obviously were right all the time. Do you want that life?</p>

    <p>An overly pragmatic way of thinking is amoral and outright wrong. </p>

    <p><em>Just 30 seconds ago the bell rang and I stood up, left my room, and the speaker said that the post arrived. I
            put on my shoes and ran down. Despite the floor being covered in ice, I ran because I thought pragmatically
            - when was the last time I slipped on ice while running? That has seldom happened before, why should it
            happen now? I challenged the universe and won, I ran and didn't slip, yet the universe is going to get
            revenge sooner or later. The universe isn't pragmatic, everything in it is ideal, and that's why science
            works in the first place. Acting against the universe is the ultimate way to unhappiness. </em></p>

    <p>I knew that running on ice with flip-flops was dangerous, it had the finite upside that I would save two minutes,
        yet it threatened me with a life in pain, as I could slip bad enough to cause irreparable damage. Of course, one
        could argue that the worst-case scenario never happens, yet this constitutes a pragmatic line of thinking.
        Pragmatism is the line of thinking opposed to idealism. Pragmatism is arrogant, as it's based on experience and
        not on humility, humility knowing that one could be wrong. Pragmatism is the egoistic way of thinking, where one
        puts his world above the world of ideals. </p>

    <p>That means, pragmatism sees the paths of life with its obstacles and tries to find some way around everything,
        instead of fighting for what is meaningful. Hence, pure pragmatism tries to describe the world as spiritually
        feminine, as reactive. While compromises are often necessary, <em>to say something pragmatic</em>, the pragmatic
        line of
        thought often creates problems, because people thinking pragmatically often deny the existence and significance
        of ideals. Especially, because most people have fully pragmatic thoughts and their idealism has been beaten out
        of them, as they noticed to be incompetent to enforce ideals. Because they are too, in lack of a better word,
        weak, to implement their ideals, they start to cope with a pragmatic way of thinking. </p>

    <p><em>A fox desired juicy, ripe, sweet grape. Those grapes hung high and after trying to reach them by jumping the
            fox gave up, claiming that reaching these grapes wasn't practical. </em>- Inspired by Aesop</p>

    <p>Most people try to stay practical because they have given up. They claim that being practical aligns with good
        sense. </p>

    <p><em>Visualize, being at sea with your sailing ship and seeing a beacon in the distance. It is dark and it rains
            heavily, the beacon is barely visible, and the waves are high. You may say that the ideal doesn't exist
            since most of the horizon is the rough sea. Or you may look at that beacon with your spyglass and
            acknowledge that it exists, often not too distant. </em></p>

    <p>Distancing yourself from the ideal is problematic as the ideal constitutes default existence, math is ideal and
        it excels at describing the essence of the universe while pragmatic thinking fails in the description of
        everything except the human ego. You need many ideals, yet only one pragmatic thought. </p>

    <p>After a legend dies, little people remember their pragmatic actions. Everything pragmatic is irrelevant and
        short-sighted, from a larger viewpoint and under the presence of strength. Why should you shortcut morality,
        which is always ideal, when you are the powerful one? No one will remember you if your life was lived
        pragmatically, only the things you've left will matter. </p>

    <p>One cannot desire to be the person who needs to compromise on everything all the time to get their way, because
        doing so will remove the possibility of doing so. Do you know why? Ideals create, and pragmatism reacts. You
        can't want to desire to be the reactive one. To be practical, a life lived reacting to things is a life lived in
        weakness and weakness is undesirable in any situation. A king will never rise to power without promoting his
        ideals, because one does not want a reactionary in the role of a creator. Some reactions will help the leader to
        propel himself forward, while the ideals are the foundation. Yet, even a leader must remember to never
        compromise on morality, because otherwise, he will live in paranoia. Paranoia is reactionary, i.e., the
        pragmatic, and paranoia is inescapable, thus creating a situation where the leader is unable to be conscious,
        this has always led to massive suffering for the people, called tyranny. Tyranny is the attempt to compensate
        for feminity (reaction) with the help of masculinity (order), yet this is misaligned with the universe, hence
        it's unsustainable.</p>

    <p>“<em>A servant once asked his kind what it felt like to be a king and so they switched roles for a week. The
            servant got excited to sit on the throne and to lead the country, yet was mostly concerned about the
            pleasures. He
            looked up and saw, that the king tied a sword right above the throne, where the servant would sit. The sword
            hung on a single hair.”</em> - text 97</p>

    <p>So, do you know what I meant to say? I meant to say that your children might hate you and I'm saying this to slap
        you awake, as you must understand this before it's too late.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Your children don't love you.</em></strong></p>

    <p><em>My mother wants to provide for the family and works effectively all day long, all to 'give the right
            financial opportunities for us children.' Yet, how often do ancients need to explain, that no one cares too
            much about materialism beyond a certain point? I doubt my little brother loves her more because of her
            absence, I certainly love her less because of it. What do I need a mother who is under pressure because of
            her work, and annoyed when coming home? Just so she can afford a better camera for me? To hell with that
            camera, I would have rather wanted more love, yet now it's too late and I'm moving away soon. I understand
            that in the past years, she had little choice, being rational and remembering the things you've done isn't
            sufficient, whether you want it or not…</em></p>


    <p><em>It was only a hug from my mother and some tears that made me feel loved.</em></p>

    <p>You see, from a pragmatic perspective, it makes perfect sense. After all, you have to be practical and can't
        survive on love alone, you also need shoes. She worked to provide for her children, yet one will conclude that
        the price was great. From an idealistic and spiritual perspective, humans are beings of love. </p>

    <p>Some cases are a lot worse, there are cases where weakness is so widespread that even the children are forced to
        work. The parents are unproductive and the children are unproductive as well, which means, that they have to
        work all day long. Unproductive doesn't mean that they aren't doing something, what they doing is simply of
        little value, well knowing the cruelty of this statement. Some people work a lot harder for a lot less money and
        those people develop even more resentment. These people live a fully inauthentic, pragmatic life, one where they
        do only practical things. Of course, the responsibility for their situation goes to them if they are living in a
        developed country, but that doesn't matter for this text. Some parents get so invested in their careers, often
        beyond the point of what is necessary, and neglect the family.</p>

    <p>I wasn't neglected - I'm the exception in every statistic because I got extremely lucky, unbelievably lucky, and
        I need to be grateful. Yet some children won't a hug from their mother because some people are too pragmatic. -
        Some people value alcohol over a functioning family. They will go to the pub on a Friday evening to numb
        themselves, desperately trying to kill their mind. They will come home in the morning to a family that resents
        them, rightfully so. No one cares or sees that alcoholism is necessary to cope with the draining 12-hour shifts
        to provide for the children, the children are only going to see the low productivity, absence, and alcohol.
        People valuing their career above their family are no better. Of course, there is an exception, if you are 16
        years old, you must put your career above everything, because otherwise you will get older and have nothing
        left. Yet, this isn't the person I'm talking about either, I'm talking about the parents who put their career
        above the family because of their pragmatism. They value money more than family. I'm talking about the woman who
        gets her first child at 28 and the man who gets married at 30, which most people are and which most parents are.
        They value going to the restaurant once a week more than living free of regret at the age of 50. They want to
        “enjoy themselves” while young. Those people think, that finishing university is more important than starting a
        family. And when they do start a family, they will still prioritize their work. To contrast it, my mother got me
        at the age of 22 and she is alright and working as a teacher. </p>

    <p>Yet, one must ultimately accept that normal people will be unable to recover from the deficit of love, especially
        when neglected whilst young. Feminism is cruel, it tells us that a child of a few months of age needs to be
        given away to kindergarten just so that one can earn more money, pure pragmatism. Luckily, most of my audience
        is young and will listen to this warning. No one cares about money beyond the age of 40, especially not your
        children, if that comes at the cost of your absence. Your children will neglect you if you don't love them and
        spend your life slaving away in a job. They are going to feel your annoyance. They won't take care of you,
        instead, they will put you in a retirement home, just as you put them in a kindergarten. </p>

    <p>If the man spends his days away from his family and comes back from exhaustion, his wife and children aren't
        going to think that he did it to increase their material well-being, instead, they will simply feel neglected.
        Frighteningly, that often reflects reality, as the man will try to avoid coming home. What does a woman need
        from this man, if she can work herself? Sure, while living in absolute, brutal poverty, which everyone before
        1900 did, money will help the relationship, yet not in today's world. You don't need to make extremely much
        money if the only thing you will be able to buy is a new car. Beyond a certain point, additional income does
        zero to well-being. </p>

    <p>What is success, is it chasing money your entire life? Probably not. If your children and wife end up resenting
        you for it, as they don't care about pragmatism deep in their hearts, can you be called a successful person? Is
        it success when you aren't excited to come back home? Once you master making money, in what world does it make
        sense to further prioritize it? There is more in the world than materialism. Material goods that aren't useful
        contribute nothing to the happiness of a person. I do love my cameras, but I doubt that the new bag from an
        Italian fashion brand will bring happiness to anyone. Your woman is going to look at it with joy for a solid two
        minutes, remember it for a few days, and forget it beyond that. You must set your ambition higher than two
        minutes. She may not even remember “how many hours you've spent” to buy that bag, a much greater gift would have
        been to spend that time with her! The bigger house is something one gets quickly used to. It's exciting for one
        week and no more. The new car will begin to look old after driving it for a week and the expensive car doesn't
        drive a lot differently from the cheap, used car. It doesn't make sense to prioritize materialism. <em>Looking a
            bit
            further, humans are the most successful species. Yet, what do when you look at the price it raises some
            questions. Are we that successful when we destroyed the planet for some materialism that made no one
            happier?</em>
        What does one need always more and more for? It's a sickness if one desires constant progress in a single area
        because that area is going to kill the rest, just like cancer. The higher income won't bring joy to anyone,
        because the expenses are going to rise equally. No one is going to appreciate something one gets used to. Even
        on a low-income level, people get used to the money they are getting and make the same mistakes, for example, of
        gifting each other material things. They don't have the money and still make the same mistakes. Set your
        ambition higher. You must master every area of life, not just one. </p>


    <p>I'm going to say something extremely pragmatic, which I know to be true. I'm 16 and I write in essentially every
        text that I'm destined for success and half my texts are stories where I unlock a new lesson towards my success
        journey. Yet, I know that beyond a certain point of success, I will stop subtracting things. I know that one day
        is going to be the one, when I tell myself, “I have plentiful, my cup runneth over,” there will be a day when I
        will stop chasing money once and for all, I will only maintain what I will have built. Since I started early,
        that point is going to arrive sooner than later. I started with 13, and considering my rate of progress I should
        be done earlier than 23. What do I need riches for if the only things I'm going to buy are shoes once every 3
        years? Ironically, that's why I need to become rich. I must enable my wife and myself to have the freedom to
        choose how to live, otherwise we will be destined to live a life of pragmatic nonsense everywhere. My path takes
        significantly less effort in the long run than slaving myself away at a job. I have the privilege to break free
        because I'm lucky and because I left the first stage where most people already fail, the practical stage of
        mastering skills.</p>

    <p>Your children are living proof that excessive pragmatism stops working quickly. Add love and idealism - if you
        are strong enough. If you aren't strong enough, get strong. To give some practical tips, just hug your mother
        and tell her that you love her. Do it right now, the text isn't running away. If you consider that to be
        unpragmatic, write it instead. Don't be stupid and weak. Your children are living proof that materialism beyond
        a certain is irrelevant to happiness. There is more to life than just being practical. There is also the
        perspective, the ideal. </p>

    <p>My intent with this text is to remind yourself to be a bit more detached from the struggle of everyday life and
        to think less pragmatically because otherwise, it will trap you. You will be forced to detach once it's too
        late, and you can't wish to desire such a situation. You can't wish to desire to live a life of regret. The way
        to escape the irrelevant nonsense expressed in everyday life is - spirituality.</p>

    <p>Don't get the impression that spirituality is going to solve every problem. Yet it's going to improve every area
        of your life. Seeing more will make you worry less. A purely spiritual life isn't possible just as pure love
        isn't possible. Even the Buddha and Jesus had to clean their rooms. However, considering life's complexity,
        there's a lot you can implement and most of it takes little effort and time, such as meditation. Meditation for
        15 minutes a day costs nothing, yet anyone will find an immense increase in fulfillment. Spirituality is the
        only thing that will improve your relationship, not that perfume or handbag. It will calm you and help you
        understand the greater picture. It will detach yourself in large parts from the triviality of everyday life,
        which most people get lost in, hence they are thinking pragmatic things. Spirituality will help you to unleash
        infinite energy. Despite this, the first step to spirituality is to figure out your normal life, it's to get
        valuable skills and to get some level of progress in parallel. Unfortunately, most people don't even master this
        step. Yet, you are more ambitious than that. If you want to be relaxed, you have to become competent first. And
        after you've done that, hug your children. </p>

    <p></p>
    <p></p>

    <p>Idealism… There is more to life then getting sunk in everyday life and thinking pragmatic things. None of your
        pragmatism is going to last for eternity. Sometimes it's necessary to detach a bit from everyday life and to
        appreciate everything. Well, let me tell you, I have reached the life I desired. I had to make many sacrifices,
        yet I never have been happier.
