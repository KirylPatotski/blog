            monumental energy.</span></h1>

    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Learn from text, not from regret.</em></strong> This is a story, and it's called life. You have 2
        options, the first one being ignorance and the second one consisting of catching the fragile essence and
        constructing the finest story possible to grasp. Every day, you must face this choice, every decision derives
        from it. Staying motivated is an embracement of the second option, trying to win and losing desire is already
        the end. Motivation is of vital importance; hence it must be learned how to utilize this vigor. Simultaneously,
        you need to understand this story's rules, to be able to participate. If you are unable or unwilling to listen,
        you shall suffer and deserve it. You are in control of your life and no one else is. Be willing to take
        responsibility, everything else is a denial of reality. Denying reality, which is lying, creates delayed
        suffering, no lie comes isolated, and lying is equivalent to giving up. You may not like the rules of the game,
        yet it's important to understand how it works. You don't have to accept everything I portray to be true, that's
        not my matter. However, it's important to let go of wrong beliefs sooner rather than later, even if that results
        in you looking like an idiot for a few months to yourself. There is nothing worse than a life lived with regret
        and embraced too late. Learn from text, not from regret. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Motivation. </em></strong> . I believe that this text will remove any desire for other motivational
        videos, as it will provide everything worthy of your time to know about motivation. The goal of this text is to
        let you discover a path to mastering motivation and discipline. Motivation is the “why,” because “motive” is
        synonymous to aim. Without goals, the “why”, discipline is impossible to maintain. Discipline is doing the thing
        you don't want to do while knowing it's the right thing regardless. Yet, motivation is more important, because
        if you don't see the reason to do something, you won't do it. Discipline will help you to stay consistent and to
        do things you don't like to reach your goals, but motivation will set the goal and discipline in place. Aims are
        of vital importance. </p>

    <h1>1. Deprive yourself of anything</h1>

    <p>There is an overpowered method to figure out what's authentic and what isn't. It's about removing any
        distractions and pleasure while staring at the ceiling for hours or days on end. It gives your mind time to
        process everything and allows you to think about things nihilistic people pursue thinking about with pleasure.
        Do that if you haven't done it already and do it until you have found the answers. Think of death, your deathbed
        regrets, and after a few days of solitude, denial, and quietness, you may return. Think of the things that need
        to get done before you die, and how many of them you have already completed. Think of the things you are going
        to pursue once you have accomplished all of these things. What are you going to do after already becoming a
        billionaire? It's impossible to stay disciplined, work hard, or experience motivation, as long as this question
        remains unanswered, here is an example. Modern legends tell stories about innocent people in death camps,
        sentenced to 10 years in brutal conditions. They fight for their survival, and some survive against all odds.
        They get released and experience freedom for the first time in decades again and feel bliss, until learning that
        there is nothing left for them. Everything they missed evaporated, and faded into insignificance. After fighting
        for 10 years to survive, they are exhausted, and if everything they wanted evaporated, they see no reason
        anymore and you can think of the rest. They slow down fall on their knees and come to a final rest. There are
        many other stories like this. Imagine being a pilot and crashing in the middle of the freezing ocean with a
        15-minute life expectancy. 15 minutes to think about everything while in pain. Yet unlimited hope of rescue in
        the belief of a wonder magnifies this remaining lifetime. You see, hope, motivation and belief are of vital
        importance, and you need to figure out your source of motivation. Perhaps your current sources of motivation
        revolve around instant gratification. If you lose motivation, return to this period of quietness to return as a
        new person. This is the only meaningful way to regain motivation. </p>

    <h1>2. Hard truths you will need to understand</h1>

    <p>You must understand that everything you think to know about motivation is corrupted by weakness. Similar to the
        text on how to break free from digital addiction, there's a necessity to unwire from hostile beliefs and to
        learn more before trying to improve. Learning more about the system allows for systematic improvement,
        otherwise, you will keep making the same mistakes over and over again. The first truth is going to be revealed
        to the right in the first paragraph. <strong><em>This text isn't for women, especially not for
                mothers,</em></strong> and soon you will see why.</p>


    <p><strong><em>Your life is too easy and void.</em></strong> The protective mother is going to treat their sons in
        comfort, thus making them weak. This weakness will be problematic later on, weakness creates problems in every
        area of life, and softness makes improvement harder because of deep-rooted self-limiting beliefs. Life is brutal
        once you leave your room, it's impossible to survive as a pushover in the presence of a threat. Instead, most
        men live in their feminine fantasies of safety, in the illusion of comfort. Did you know that Versailles had
        neither toilets or heating while housing the most important people of France? The comfort of the modern person
        surpasses that of kings. There is nothing you need to worry about. Louis XIV, the king who ordered the
        construction of said castle had 40 meals cooked for him every day and he ate the one which he felt like. Today
        you can go to a supermarket and if you attempt to quantify the variety of food available to everyone, you will
        stop after counting to 500. You have everything one could ever dream of, why do you think are you complacent to
        a level where you are unable to leave the bed? Life is more brutal once you turn off your phone and leave your
        bed. Complacency is the killer of motivation, thus inducing a life filled with void. This void is caused by
        excessive comfort and needs to be filled with something because humans can't exist in a void: The inauthentic
        things to fill the deep void are fake purposes which are precisely the following: fame, money, instant
        gratification, entertainment, pleasure, promiscuity, cynicism, and nihilism. If those are solely your
        'purposes,' you will be unable to find motivation, if they are alone. Of course, you can cope by claiming that
        you like to go to the cinema once every 10 years with your future wife, but deep in your heart you will know
        that these are simply cheap replacements for what you truly desire. The life of the average person focuses on
        purely these things. A job is used to fill the fake purpose of money and their alcoholic loser friends will help
        them with instant gratification and entertainment. However, some young girls think higher than this and indulge
        in total denial of life's meaning by believing in cynicism and nihilism. “Life is meaningless” or “Life is for
        instant gratification” are the 2 phrases that signify giving up, after all, what is there left after the
        availability of infinite comfort? To put it in the words of Dostoyevsky: <em>“You know the direct, legitimate
            fruit
            of consciousness is inertia, that is, conscious sitting-with-the-hands-folded.”</em> If you can afford to
        sit with
        nothing to do, you will feel meaningless!</p>

    <p>There are a lot of things that scare me, genuinely, but they take life experience to comprehend. Let's say you
        woke up with 100,000,000€ free of constraints. How will you be able to leave bed and stand on your legs? (This
        has been discussed extensively in the text “Life is Paradise”) Complacency kills what makes life meaningful. A
        lack of meaning will make it impossible to move and progress. Freedom only makes sense in the presence of
        constraints, freedom without constraints is analogous to a sandwich without bread. If you were free to fly
        through the universe without obstacles, there would be nowhere interesting to go. The universe would be void,
        thus, you would be trapped in your spot, not knowing what to do. Mountains are constraints to your movement and
        simultaneously the objects that make walking interesting in the first place.</p>

    <p>Escaping this comfort and void is no easy task.</p>


    <p><strong><em>No one cares about the weak. </em></strong> There is a common, yet wrong, belief instilled in almost
        everyone and it's again one mostly fatherless boy suffer from, or if the father is weak. (I'm fatherless myself,
        yet luckily fate made me immune to them.) If you are a woman, you are allowed to be weak, yet no one cares about
        weak men. Let me give an example. In Spain (July 2023), I spent some time with a 19-year-old, the most
        submissive 19-year-old I've ever seen. He never sat upright or took shallow breaths, was awkward, and wasted his
        time on social media or playing video games. When I challenged him for a run, he agreed and we ran. I wanted to
        run for 4km - 10km and I certainly didn't run 25km/h, more like 8km/h and he already quit after 100m. He swam
        slower than my 8-year-old brother. And now he is perhaps sitting on his PC wasting time on social media with
        zero discipline while living with his mother.¹ “Well, at least he listens to his mother and spends time with her
        and you always do what you think” is something my mother said and you can imagine what I responded: “He doesn't
        make his mother proud.” In July I was writing blogs already and I waited to include this piece of dialog: I
        asked him how many girls had asked him out and he responded with zero, as I told him that I had been asked out,
        and knew that multiple girls had an interest in me, he couldn't fathom it. This is reality. No one cares about
        you if you are weak. </p>

    <p>Many of your ancestors went to war and you are struggling to get out of bed.</p>

    <p>However, blaming your mother for raising you in too great comfort is wrong. That's because you need to take
        radical accountability. If something good happened, congratulate yourself and if something terrible happened,
        it's still your fault. You are too feminine, emotional, submissive, slow, and have too many excuses. That's ok
        if you are a woman because some complementary opposite has to exist. But, if you are a man, this isn't in line
        with nature and neither is it in line with expectations. </p>

    <p>People will dislike you if you are weak, they will bully you, indirectly if not directly. When I was in 10th and
        11th grade, I was a loser, compared to now. My sister constantly told me how many people complained about me and
        how many didn't like me. My personality didn't change, I was the same person as in 2020, yet with the difference
        of time and effort. Now I could talk in constant black humor and it was perceived well and I see that many
        people like me, and I also like them. The world gets so much better if you advance, and so will your perception
        of it. It's a self-perpetuating development. “Well, they told me you've changed and now they kind of like you,”
        is something my sister started to report to me recently. I didn't change significantly, except that I stopped
        being a loser; here's an excerpt from my diary from when I was 12 years old, 4 years ago.</p>

    <p><em>Sunday, 3.11.2019. “So, I analyzed the moral³ and spiritual situation and I feel like creating a few
            statistics, which you will find on the next page. [They are an estimation of how much time my mother had to
            work to finance all my toys]. I went for a walk […]. Later, we went to the cinema and didn't know or care
            what the movie was about because I didn't want to go on my own.” </em></p>


    <p><strong><em> Achievement isn't relative. </em></strong> </p>

    <p>Here are 5 stories or principles to help you understand my way of thought and life, those are hard truths you
        need to accept.</p>

    <p><strong><em>If you lose, you are a loser.</em></strong> This can be misinterpreted easily and needs further
        explanation. Let's say you played an individualistic sport like judo. Recently, I went through very old videos
        and I saw one capturing my first judo fight in a competition back when I was 7. I fought hard and lost
        regardless, and it didn't matter. My mother carried me from the arena, and the instructor yelled at her to
        leave, rightfully so. This behavior is outright toxic because it undermines the essence of progress,
        competition, and failures, most people have this mentality for the rest of their life (and wonder why they
        suffer from mental health problems). “Well, you didn't fail, you gained experience. If you were less tired, you
        maybe would have won” is something most 'friends' would say to encourage, it gets even worse for collective
        sports like volleyball “Well, you gave your best, but the others were weak.” </p>

    <p>Let's just say that's not what world champions would say. If you tell me that you've lost, I will tell you.
        “Well, you see, some failures kill and reset months or years' worth of progress, but this one is most likely
        indifferent. No one cares that you have been tired. It's your fault and you have lost. Accept and move on.” No
        one cares about the second place and neither does anyone care about excuses. Participation doesn't matter, only
        the victory does. It gets tight at the top, the horse winning the horse race does so by winning “by the nose.”
        Only the first place matters, the rewards get exponentially worse from that point on. If you lost, you've lost.
        No wonder you are struggling with motivation if you get bombarded with soft words and hostile excuses, subtle
        lies to make you feel better. Yet, you shouldn't get emotional about failures in the first place. Get better or
        quit. </p>

    <p><strong><em>My 590-page blog is still trash.</em></strong> Every 12th grader in my school completed an
        8-10-page paper and some are proud of theirs. My 590-page blog is still trash, only 3 people are reading it, and
        if I compare how I wrote 2 months ago, the level of progress is immeasurable. I've spent 1,000 hours on my first
        app and it still never saw success. Most people have no understanding of work and what work even means. They
        think that an 8-page text is something worth remembering because they spent 6 focused hours on it. Brother, I
        spend 6 focused hours a day on something! That's not how it works, you master something by doing it thousands of
        times, and even then, it may not be enough to excel at winning with ease. That's why it's vital importance to
        break free from bad habits, imagine wasting 10,000 hours on social media in comparison to 10,000 hours of
        meditation. It doesn't take 70 ideas to become successful, but rather 10,000. Don't underestimate how much work
        most things take, yet don't overestimate the time it will take to complete this work. </p>

    <p>To provide extra value, here is the concept of the 20-hour rule. It takes 20 hours to become 80% as good as a
        master if you have the right teacher. Yet, being good at something will hold you back from becoming great at
        something. You only need to be great a 1 or 2 things to become successful. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Learn fast and stay humble.</em></strong> My brother goes ice skating every week and spent 20 hours
        there already. Do you think that he applied the 20-hour rule? No, he is too scared, hence, he is using a metal
        scaffold to protect himself from slipping. I learned to walk on ice within 2 hours by refusing to use that
        nonsense when I was 11. Only if you aren't scared of falling will you be able to learn correctly. Using a metal
        scaffold is a direct detachment from reality, a lie. You already know how every lie ends, it's delayed
        suffering. This method of learning 'with protection' breeds weakness, because some areas don't have this kind of
        protection, for example, programming. You can't prevent a contradiction from killing the program and expect it
        to be taken care of by your mother. Courses where children learn to swim are the biggest nonsense. Let them fall
        into the water and fight. Let's say someone is used to learning the soft way. They won't even attempt real
        challenges and this will lead to the previously discovered problems.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Can't handle criticism, little pushover?</em></strong> You're not special, most likely you are just
        a loser. Forget about being special. You can become special, but you aren't special. You won't become successful
        through a coincidence unless you have been working towards it for years. Your parents wanted you to believe that
        you are special so that they¹ could project their dark desires onto you. My 8-year-old brother plays the flute.
        Someone advised me that if I should tell him that it sounds trash, he will be in tears and quit (even though he
        is 8!). For most people it's nothing different, they listen to criticism and self-limiting beliefs from their
        own or others. What kind of character are you building if you are susceptible to criticism? You may listen to
        criticism, but some people get emotional or personal about it. Guess how many people, especially from my family,
        still criticize² and doubt me? </p>

    <p>Praise is powerful to motivate the feminine, not the masculine as it means the goal is already accomplished.
        Someone's drawings were trash when she started to draw, but they kept lying about their quality. This made her
        continue with art and now she wants to study it. But then, the same thing happened as you would expect: the lie
        collapsed as she went to an entrance exam at the university OR she got excellent good at it and praise led her
        to pursue art further. Praise can be poisonous, let me give another example. If your wife starts to bake, and
        you reward that by praising it, you will have to eat a lot more sugar in the future. </p>

    <p><strong><em>You little idiot.</em></strong> When I get told something I have no idea about, or that I realize
        to be wrong I implement it, even if it takes a few days. Most people try to defend something wrong, even after
        realizing it's wrong themselves. That's not how to learn properly. </p>

    <h1>3. Egoistic sources of motivation</h1>

    <p>Now, you have learned a few principles you will need to follow and some truths you need to understand. You aren't
        special, you learn like a weakling, criticism displays your weakness, no one cares about the weak, it's easy to
        underestimate how much you have to do to master something, you are too feminine, your life is too comfortable,
        meaningless, and void. That should be enough to build the foundation. Because once you acknowledge your
        weakness, you shall be able to improve.</p>

    <p>Egoistic sources of motivation are extremely powerful and are based on energy transmutation, meaning some sort of
        craving gets used to serve something else. Yet, egoistic sources of motivation will run dry eventually, because
        one day you will wake up and notice that you already have plentiful, your cup runneth over. Some day you will
        have zero motivation to go to the gym because you have already built your body. You will still go because it has
        become a habit. One day, you will wake up and think to yourself that you have nothing important to do and stay
        in bed. In extreme scenarios, you will die, because egoistic motivation isn't enough, like in the example of the
        plane crash or the camp. Hence, egoistic sources of motivation are all based on utilizing the energy from within
        to view the bigger picture.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Perspective, the life you want, the “why.”</em></strong> As previously discussed, you will need to
        find the reason why you are doing something and what you are doing it for. This goal needs to be large enough to
        make it possible to align 100% of your life to it. Without goals and a purpose, you are in precisely the same
        position as 5 years ago and the future. Thus, escaping complacency will be impossible. For years, my “why” were
        my apps, now it's YouTube. You must have a life goal, which will take years or decades to complete, and you must
        be able to split it into smaller goals, which only take months or years. You don't want to waste your life.
        Visualize. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Pressure.</em></strong> I need to get rich as soon as possible because I don't know what the future
        is going to look like, it seems that it's going to be socialism for the rich. That means, everyone is going to
        own nothing and live a miserable life, while the elites own everything. You can see these trends emerging
        everywhere. So, get rich while you can! If this pressure isn't concrete enough, deadlines accelerate. They add
        certainty, accountability, and things to leverage your subconscious. If your goal is just within reach, it will
        be easier to stay motivated, motivation increases as the goal approaches, if the result depends on effort until
        the last second. Competition is another powerful thing to motivate you. If you can't run 10km, let others join.
        Try to catch up to something or somebody. Perhaps you are simply missing good friends to motivate you. When this
        isn't enough, motivate yourself by saying: “I do it to sleep well tonight, I want to know that I've done
        everything there was to do and went to my limit.” Exhaustion is nice, both mental and physical. That's because
        you know you have given your best. If that's not enough, add pressure by pinning your goals to your wall. “Well,
        I can't work under pressure” is a phrase showing too much feminism in your belief system. You can work
        excellently when under pressure, that's why it's possible to complete a project quickly once the deadline
        approaches. When you have to do something because you are responsible for it or because it is expected, it's
        easy to find enough motivation. Keep in mind that you want to make the most out of the day and that you want to
        live the best year of your life. Eventually, you will get used to living this way and it will no longer require
        motivation. Also, remember the compound effect.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Energy transmutation.</em></strong> Discipline removes almost any negative character traits. I get
        emotional about something sometimes, but then I think to myself, “Why am I acting this way, I have enough
        self-control to choose what thoughts to think and what emotion to feel” However, using energy, especially from
        emotions is a very powerful method, although sometimes risky, for example, <a href="blog_63.html">traumas</a> can accelerate and slow down.
    </p>

    <p>Do you feel insecure? Well, fix it by proving everyone wrong. Compensate and live the extreme life, where you
        show everyone that they need to be insecure around you instead. Insecurities show that something didn't go the
        way it was supposed to. Well, then fix it and excel. </p>

    <p>Traumas accelerate. For the first years of my self-improvement journey, until May 2023, I was in genuine pain
        from all of the nonsense that happened in the last years. As the traumas were fresh, they stopped further
        progress, but after a while passed, they accelerated. In June 2023 I had a kind of burnout and there were a lot
        of reasons. For one, the 50 failures, 2.5 years of constant performance, the girl that rejected me, some cracks
        in my apps, and another thing: suddenly, traumas, along with other negatives of the mind were missing. I was
        missing pain to continue, yet pain is vital for motivation. Luckily, those things I just listed gave me enough
        pain and I continued. Then, in September and October, I had no pain either. That's why I artificially created
        some and now I keep going again. However, now I'm confident I've figured out how to keep going without pain. Yet
        moving without pain feels a lot worse: I was able to take no break for 2.5 years as I was in pain, and now I'm
        forced to take breaks, despite hating them.</p>

    <p>As I was in pain since September, you could observe how drastically the texts improved. That's transmuted energy.
        The average text had a scope of 700 words before September and since September around 2300.</p>

    <p>Revenge shouldn't be a source of motivation but regret is another powerful motivator, it made me quit my digital
        addiction because it released enough pain. If regret isn't about you, let that girl regret rejecting or breaking
        up with you. Anger is similar to regret. If you have had enough, you will find a reason to change. I think every
        negative emotion was designed to give motivation and strength, and not to be used as a drug and just indulged.
        If you feel sad, simply enter a period of absolute discipline. </p>

    <p>Well, of course, there are also positive emotions motivating, for example, love, but it ends there. That's
        because positive emotions are the reward for doing things right. </p>

    <p>It's important to analyze where your current sources of pleasure are, chances are, they aren't your work. For
        example, I like writing, I can focus for 6 hours straight on it, the creativity guide has been written in one
        session, from 3:50 to 9:50. If your pleasure comes from digital addiction, sugar, or anything else that isn't
        work, you are in trouble. Chances are, bad habits are stealing your energy released by traumas. How are you
        supposed to be motivated to do something hard if you believe that work sucks and only entertainment is
        pleasurable? Well, you already know the most powerful single motivator, your sexual desire. Controlling what
        gets your energy is risk-free in comparison to traumas. Additionally, other texts went into this in greater
        detail, but if your room isn't clean, you've eaten unhealthy food, and have poor sleeping habits. How are you
        supposed to be motivated, if your environment kills any motivation?</p>

    <p><em>“There are 2 single motivators, the desire to gain pleasure and the desire to minimize pain. Every motivation
            that comes into your mind can be categorized in one of them or even in both. […] Using this knowledge, the
            answer to the question of how to gain motivation becomes already obsolete. Let's say you need the motivation
            to start something life-changing, where would you place the moment of the decision, at an emotional high or
            an emotional low? Only if you are truly unhappy, you will be willing to change, to avoid pain. If you don't
            experience this level of pain, which is necessary for you to break free, let a few more years pass by. You
            will see how many opportunities you missed, how much of your health got removed, how much your future got
            worse because of short-term thinking, how much potential got destroyed for nothing, how many days passed
            without progress, how often you struggled for nothing and you will realize how many years of your life have
            been wasted, how many years of your youth have been wasted, and you will gain the ultimate portion of
            motivation through something called regret, a bitter form of pain because lasting exceptionally long. Once
            you experience this, it may already be too late to change your life, but at least you thought, that you had
            fun as you were younger. Unfortunately, it's not enough to decide rationally, that you want to improve your
            life, because you will slip back towards comfort easily. You have to make your current situation as painful
            as possible, to be able to make exceptional progress. Visualizations can help, otherwise, there is no
            shortcut.”</em> - From blog #12</p>

    <p>Additionally, there is another piece of the puzzle necessary to transmute energy. You need an identity shift. For
        example, you aren't a loser, instead, you are someone who is trying to conquer the system that mistreated you.
        You aren't regretting something; you are making up for the damage. It's vital to take radical responsibility
        because otherwise, any pain will turn into paralysis. </p>

    <p><em>Running out of motivation, just suffer more while utilizing responsibility! To add more motivation, let go of
            everything and refocus again.</em></p>

    <p><strong><em>The proper life lets every negative be compensated.</em></strong> A recent text of mine starts
        something like this. <em>I feel broken. I am thinking highly of myself and staying disciplined helps. I have a
            massively inflated ego and think to deserve more than everyone else, this self-perception allows me to
            accomplish. It's a self-fulfilling hypothesis, in essence. I have often challenged myself and worked as hard
            as could for months on end. I did what I was supposed to do, and followed my purpose.</em> There is more to
        this excerpt than meets the eye. It means, if you're arrogant, you must live accordingly to transmute the energy
        and to stay accountable. If I tell everyone that I get up at 3:30, it's super easy to do this, especially if
        you're arrogant. “Well, you little pushovers, all of you are still sleeping and I'm the only one working on my
        future. When the clock turns 9:30 I will have accomplished more than any of you in the last week” It gives so
        much strength, for example, while fighting in the sports class, I can't lose unless I fight against someone 30kg
        heavier than me. You must spend your arrogance on these things rather than on other people. This is the perfect
        example of identity creating pressure and pressure motivation and it applies to every weakness in your
        character.</p>

    <h1>4. Real, external sources of motivation</h1>

    <p>Leaving the current moment and thinking further forward is vital to regain motivation. Real sources of motivation
        take this to the next level by removing you entirely. You start to see the bigger picture and exit the simple
        perspective of an individual, hence undifferentiating everything related to everything not related to your
        goals. Your goals are the only thing remaining, everything else, every step to step or emotion to feel will fade
        into insignificance. There is so much more to reality than meets the eye and focusing on the outward makes
        current emotions, and thoughts seem insignificant. </p>

    <p>This fits perfectly in the flow of the text as well as its content, and here are 5 techniques to stop
        nervousness. First, reframe it into excitement, because it feels the same, secondly, don't be a loser and stand
        upright while breathing deep breaths, thirdly practice, and fourthly don't wait, fourthly have absolute
        awareness of the outward and the long term, this will help you to do the right things. If you practice this
        enough, even if just mentally, nervousness will disappear forever. The last time I've been nervous was 5 months
        ago (many times have I been on stage/display since). Focusing on the outward can be practiced. </p>


    <p><strong><em>She.</em></strong> By now it should already be obvious, but you may still not be fully aware of the
        scope. Picking the right woman is the single most important decision. That's because you will spend the rest of
        your life with her. Hence, work hard to attract the right one. Sure, having the right career is important, but
        only in the context of materialism, and remember the example of the beginning. The right career isn't enough on
        its own and the career can be changed, it isn't your life companion. A career can fail and you can simply
        restart, however, relationships shouldn't fail. She gives motivation at any stage, whether it be at the
        beginning when you need to work on yourself to get her, once you start meeting each other to keep her, or to
        build a family. Some older people will say that living together makes it easier, especially once older, but I
        don't consider that to be true in my situation. </p>

    <p>Notes from Sunday, 12.11.2023. <em>“I've done nothing noteworthy yesterday and sort of relaxed during the day. I
            went for a simple walk, finished reading a philosophical book, and did some homework. Then I went to sleep
            as usual at 19:30 to get up at 3:30 and that's what I've done. Then, when the day turned from the 11th to
            the 12th and the alarm bell rang at 3:30, I was already half awake. I got out of bed right away as I
            conditioned myself to, and had already prepared the task that I wanted to complete. I wanted to record a
            YouTube video on the text where I explained that the period between 1.12.23 and 29.2.2024 is exactly 90 days
            long. I wanted to learn what it felt like to record a video in the morning as it would become my new habit
            in that time. Yet, starting the day with the hardest task makes getting up even harder and so I continued
            sleeping until 8:00, meaning I slept 12 hours long. Now, what do you think would that situation look like,
            if I lived with a woman? Life is going to get 10 times harder because no excuses are allowed at all times
            and she will keep watching at all times. By the way, I did end up recording the video a few hours later, but
            that came at a lesson already obvious to me. No one else I know has such a story to tell yet it's all
            relative. Me getting up at 8 is the mediocre person's equivalent of getting up at 13:00. I've effectively
            sacrificed 6 hours of deep focus for nothing. Accordingly, that's how I felt.” </em> </p>


    <p>I already knew these things years ago (as early as 10 years of age, that explains why I rejected some girls) but
        here is something new that I didn't know: if your supposed future wife does something that makes you lose
        respect for her, for example, if she spends time with (male) losers, it's not possible to gain any extra energy
        from it because it means, that you were wrong. For multiple reasons, which can apply simultaneously; firstly,
        you've thought higher of a girl who's, in essence, a loser, is attracted to losers, has no idea of how life
        works or tries to rescue them instead to compensate. There is a decently detailed tractate I've written on it
        already a while ago and it is linked <a href="blog_28.html">here</a>. The last thing is the worst of them all
        because it can get “justified,” yet the justification reveals bigger problems. If you want a more extensive
        version of that text,
        read the book “Notes from the Underground” by Dostoyevsky (I've read it and you can see how it changed my
        writing). You may point out that teaching others is the same thing as trying to rescue someone. However, I'm not
        your friend, I'm your teacher. Any of these scenarios of spending time with male losers discussed have terrible
        consequences, but let a few years pass by and she⁴ will learn with the help of a thing called regret. These
        scenarios are terrible for you too, because they imply the insignificance of hard work and they show cracks in
        your judgment/belief system. Why should you develop if the loser gets more attention, than you? This pain just
        numbs you because it means she won't regret rejecting you, instead, she will seek more contact with losers as
        opposed to in any way to compensate for her weakness, constituting energy transmuted in the wrong way. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Your parents are going to get older sooner than you think. </em></strong> This is the least
        abstract of every idea discussed. You owe your parents money; retirement won't exist soon. On the internet, you
        may see some super-young millionaire, from what I know, that could have been me if my parents slapped me in the
        face and asked me every day what I was doing to become successful, before the age of 13 I was doing exactly
        nothing. Well, someday your parents will get weak and if they start to suffer from dementia, they will lose the
        ability to work. Sure, the government may want to help, but where is that money supposed to come from? From the
        current lazy kids wasting their time on social media? You need to take control. </p>

    <p><strong><em>A teacher whose students surpass him becomes immortal. </em></strong> My education and upbringing
        were wrong in almost everything, they gave me the wrong beliefs, attitudes, and values, at the same time, they
        somehow did a great job of teaching me how to think, and act and set me up for greatness. That means, there was
        something I got that almost no one else got, thus I must be grateful and make the most out of it - I owe that to
        the universe, or how you may call it. My mother is no woman of philosophy, science, or business, yet still what
        I've learned and will learn will be sufficient. I will never become a billionaire, but I will live a prosperous
        life. However, my children will learn what my parents, grandparents, and what a future and successful version of
        myself is going to know. In essence, get as rich, successful, and wise as possible to establish the immortality
        of your name and children through the help of a legendary legacy. Isn't the positive immortality of your name
        one of your greatest motivators there is? Even if you don't see the success of becoming metaphorically immortal,
        if your children surpass you by a lot, you've cemented yourself. Think of your future self and far beyond it,
        maybe 1000 years into the future, you can also establish immortality by collecting wisdom.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Always keep in mind your limited time. </em></strong> </p>

    <p><strong><em> Final words.</em></strong> I certainly needed a lot of motivation to write this text, because I've
        failed 3 times and started from scratch 3 times over, even more for the appendix. Yet, often starting with
        something without overthinking is the best thing to do, because after 10 minutes of doing something, you enter a
        flow and the task becomes effortless. Procrastination is a bad habit that you can get rid of, there are 2 texts
        I've written on it, #70 “Desperate Awakening” and #5 “Full Procrastination Guide.” In essence, text #70 explains
        why you are craving intense emotions: they create meaning and presence. Then text #5 explains how to use the
        knowledge from text #70 to overcome procrastination. The appendix provides further insights into the single
        desire to work on.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Appendix: Unconstrained reality, out of context </em></strong> </p>

    <h1>Freedom</h1>

    <p><strong><em>In essence, the only desire.</em></strong> What do want, really? Deprive yourself from any pleasure,
        stimuli, distraction, input, and every item that occupies your mind. Write down any thought as entering your
        mind, until you no longer have any. At that point, your mind is clear and you will feel with atom-splitting
        precision what I described in a variety of texts. At that point, what do you assume to enter your mind? It's
        void. Something is interesting I never described in any of my previous texts: I don't think. Sometimes I have
        some thoughts, but most of the time I live without them. That's not because thinking is something useless, it's
        because it needs to be intentional to be of use. When you advance your mind far enough, you may encounter the
        same scenario. While writing these texts or recording YouTube videos or any other work, there is nothing I'm
        thinking about. I don't want to go into great detail, as many texts dived deeper into these topics, most notably
        texts #70 and #44. </p>

    <p>Chances are, you are having thoughts and you are unable to control most of them. There are inauthentic desires
        chained to having thoughts outside of your sphere of influence. In one of my older texts, I went into detail
        about desire assessment. The method works by breaking down desires by splitting them into smaller ones on paper
        to find the truth: most desires are completely artificial, sometimes based on a joke by someone you hardly know
        which wasn't meant as an insult that stuck in your mind and forced some overcompensation. If you said it aloud
        or wrote it down, it would have removed a wide array of things you craved. In the same way, it's possible to
        assess opinions, desires, and beliefs. At the same time, it's possible to look at the origin of desires as well
        as the way they are leading, where they come from, and where they go. </p>

    <p>It's more complicated than that, some assessments lead to different results for different people or different
        life situations. It's possible to get contradictory assessments for wanting a job versus being an entrepreneur.
    </p>

    <p>Yet, at the same time, there are a few desires, which will collide as soon as you try to assess them. a few
        atomic desires that are independent of your life situation, age, wealth, or education, and impossible to prove
        any inauthenticity via a splitting assessment. Some are fairly obvious, for example, growth, connection, esteem,
        safety, achievement, fulfillment, transcendence (the extraordinary), and contribution. There is one atomic
        desire of magnified importance, transcending every other desire and creating ties between them. Can you guess
        which desire, or I should rather say, need is? Try to assess the desire for freedom and you will find it
        impossible to find some deep-rooted insecurity for which you are trying to compensate. </p>

    <p><strong><em>The only true desire is freedom paired with meaning and authenticity.</em></strong> </p>

    <p>Imagine a scenario, where you would have everything your heart desires, and everything you find valuable. A
        family, awards, wealth, health, and living a full life overall with a catch: you would be trapped. You would
        have no freedom of expression, movement, or thought. Everything would already be determined, in your favor. Your
        life would be destined to become perfect if you just complied with docility. Would you take this deal? Let's
        make it harder to resist. Everyone lives in starvation and abuse, and you get the same offer: giving up your
        freedom for the perfect life. A life with no freedom is meaningless, shallow, and inauthentic. If you had
        everything, it would all be meaningless if you were trapped. You could have everything, yet there would be a
        dark thought at all times in your mind reminding you that everything is meaningless. Where is authenticity
        supposed to come from, if you don't have any freedoms, and where should meaning originate if there is no way to
        live authentically?</p>

    <p><strong><em>Where freedom comes from.</em></strong> </p>

    <p><strong><em>Freedom, that's money, ownership, passports, and control of time.</em></strong> </p>
    <p><strong><em>Freedom, that's every time you are making a decision. </em></strong> </p>
    <p><strong><em>Freedom, that's living according to your purpose. </em></strong> </p>
    <p><strong><em>Freedom, that's how you choose to interpret the world. </em></strong></p>

    <p>¹ Everyone has some negative trait that is hidden deep beneath the surface which transcends through every other
        quantity. This negative trait is impossible to remove, as it's an integral part of each individual's personality
        and thinking. Deep engraved and impossible to remove, also because rewarded logically, it becomes negative when
        it is no longer useful. Mothers often have this negative trait, where their inner imbalance gets projected onto
        their children. For example, by not letting them go or by buying them 20 sweaters when 3 are already enough. My
        negative trait - I don't know it fully. I think it's that I have very little understanding of anything beyond
        good sense. </p>

    <p>² There are a few things I've done to eliminate most of it. Firstly, I let time pass and progress accelerate, and
        secondly, I started writing down what I was doing every day. </p>

    <p>³ I wasn't aware of how little I changed. I didn't find that moment right away so looked at my notes and learned
        about myself. </p>

    <p>⁴ Here is an overview of my current situation. In June, I've asked her out and got rejected, and not much
        happened since. From September she kept talking about how great that loser was. With a delay of 1.5 and in
        combination with the death of my first app, I got weakened and started to lose interest in her, at first by
        around 90% at the end of October (#87), then it stabilized at 50% lower (#90) and it stayed that way until
        others pointed out how much time she spends with that loser and on social media, but my interest didn't decrease
        further, because she started to show increased interest in me, recently even more. Then, yesterday I saw her
        with that loser with my own eyes, which means, that she isn't too interested in me and hasn't read my texts, and
        if she has read them, it means that her will to improve isn't existent, that's why now my interest got reduced
        by 85% in one moment. The next one or two weeks will determine the rest of both our lives. I know it seems easy
        to say the obvious from an outside perspective that I should let go, however, her spending time with losers and
        on social media are the only negatives I know of and I know far more positives. But often, one negative trait is
        enough to annulate every positive combined, and this one of them. However, her improvement is still possible,
        even if may I not be the one affected by it. However, I do acknowledge that my emotional unavailability may have
        caused permanent damage to her and I don't know what to do here either. Moving on will be much easier for me
        than for her because I will only have a negligible low level of permanent regret, but she will most likely never
        find a person like me, because those are simply rare and they won't be interested in her either, because they
        will already be taken and she will become less attractive in the following years, while I will become more
        attractive. Her whole life could go downhill from here because women who aren't loved live in suffering and will
        keep making the same mistakes over and over again trying to compensate. Well, I regret not making any steps
        further after getting initially rejected, however, for her it must be a lot worse because she was the once who
        made the decision. It's hard to live with pain which you are responsible for. She will find someone decent (or
        maybe even an abusive loser, if that compensatory behavior persists) but that missed chance will be impossible
        to ignore. I don't know what the result of the next few weeks is going to be, because that remaining 15% could
        turn into 0% fast. </p>

    <p>I don't know, if I mentioned it, or not, but this text was originally written in a much weaker essence on the
        20th
        and 21st of April 2023, and guess what the next page of my notebook was about. It was about the 10,000-math task
        challenge. Generally, I now feel similar to how I felt in April, about to experience a few great months, even
        better if she improves.</p>
