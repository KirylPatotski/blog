    <h1>It's your fault</h1>

    <p><em><strong>You see what you like.</strong></em> I'm no mediocre person, and I don't know why I'm explicitly
        mentioning it. Normally, people want to portray them better by claiming that no one helped them or believed in
        them. yet, no one ever doubted that I'm out of the ordinary - whether you call it crazy, weird, or genius. So,
        saying that you are special stems from insecurity... Every idiot can justify himself, because after something
        happens reality molds into the obvious and self-explanatory. Often, things seem to become clear after they are
        completed and the events contradicting this reality get ignored. If something fails, that's because you ignored
        the fragile cracks forming beneath the carpet and something succeeds if you made progress despite the cracks.
        Any idiot can admit to being wrong and it takes even less intelligence to be proud of a victory. Everyone can
        and will point to the cracks of someone, but everyone is blind to view his own. Everyone tries to defend
        themselves; everyone has a corrupted perspective. The word bias doesn't make sense, because everyone has it.
        Hence, it's easy to complain about the past, yet almost impossible to look into the future, since reality is
        built in a way, where ninety-five percent of it is a projection of the mind. You see and hear what you want to
        and discard the rest. You only pay attention to what you find exciting and filter out the rest, often without
        noticing. You will think, that you know better because admitting being wrong puts you in an awkward position and
        sometimes the position of knowing better comes at the very end. </p>

    <p><em><strong>It's time to grow up.</strong></em> A lot of people try to ignore their limited perspective and match
        the energy of a young child who knows nothing about anything and puts the blame onto others as their only
        defense mechanism to allow themselves to remain in the sweet passivity of being unknowledgeable. There is no
        blame without responsibility and no responsibility without intent if the individual claims to be without
        knowledge. Children are evil because they know that blaming others will bring them comfort, pointing fingers
        never finds consequences, but rather rewards. Precisely this behavior can be observed in adults who never
        learned what responsibility means and instead obsess over comfort. These people claim to be wise by pointing to
        the prettiness of the carpet they bury their weaknesses. The more opulent and magnificent the carped looks the
        more sophisticated the lies become that can be buried beneath it. So, some people try to hide their
        responsibility by pointing to the opulence of the carpet, how can it be wrong if the carpet radiates nobility?
        How can an inexperienced child be blamed for pointing fingers? </p>

    <p><em><strong>I don't need to cope. </strong></em> It does not make sense to assume the fault to lie in the hands
        of someone else. What does that bring to you except comfort and a simple way to cope? It's nice to get your
        mother to hug you after you felt insulted from the fight you provoked with someone stronger. It's nice to feel
        the comfort of a mother, her warm hug, and her delicate soft voice. It's easy to list the ten thousand reasons
        not to be where you wanted to be. Obviously - no I mean - doubtlessly it's the fault of someone else. After all,
        otherwise, your mother would be telling you otherwise and how can she be wrong if she wants the best for you?
        Perhaps you no longer cry in your mother's arms and instead get so-called friends to cope with the emptiness of
        your existence and your lack of inner strength. How can one reject modern comforts, and come to terms with
        'reality'? <em>“You live in the 21st century and comfort is alright; it does not make sense to contradict every
            standard, you only lose by doing so. Phones are a good thing; the truth is just a product of time and
            ever-changing. There can't be such a thing as a coherent human nature, you can't even compare the people
            from the current to the last generation. Go and live life like a normal person”</em> Yet, I find it
        unacceptable to follow the crowd, that rarely serves anyone. I refuse to compare myself to anyone as I would not
        be able to live, I don't know anyone who has control of their mind and their life. I do not desire people's
        demonstration of comfort's embracement; I don't need to see people who are on their phones just to feel superior
        again or to feel happy with a lack of discipline. You are fundamentally alone when you play this game. There
        will be no one on your side because they don't want anyone to elevate themselves who came from the same
        circumstances. No one wants you to break free, no one wants you to embrace responsibility, they want a hug from
        their mothers rather than a slap from reality, telling them to wake up. You don't need comfort, you need
        responsibility. Telling lies is easy, comfort is easy. Only when you start to embrace responsibility will things
        change, because change starts with you and you only. The truth, it always comes out. Sometimes it is suppressed
        and surfaces only after centuries, yet eventually it does. The longer it is suppressed, the more detonating the
        impact is going to be. It does not make sense to try to suppress the truth. You lie to yourself more than you do
        to anyone else and that's what's making you despise yourself. Are you willing to stop lying to yourself?</p>

    <p><em><strong>Failures kill — death by a thousand small cuts.</strong></em> Every catastrophe is difficult to see -
        you see what you want to see and are often presented with contradictory evidence. And most of the time it's
        never one decision that makes the difference. It's a thousand small sawings that cut the tree to collapse. When
        the marriage fails, it's not because of one silly comment, but instead of ten thousand instances of disrespect.
        It's never the case that a man suddenly becomes abusive, it's because other people let it happen. No one is
        random enough to cross barriers for no reason, every time the reaction is tested and the behavior adjusted,
        rather frequently it spirals down, while other times the other force reacts too strongly. It's never a single
        drop of water that brings a dam to break, but rather the trillions that came before it. Most people would try to
        defend people who seemingly are worse off than them. I know many losers and I know that all of them are
        indulging in instant gratification, no matter which day of the time you are reading this text. Every day you get
        to choose whether you want to be a winner or a loser. Every time, those people choose to waste their time. You
        might be tempted to argue that they just don't know any different. Well, I used to be a collection of bad habits
        just like them and broke free, and it was not a lot more complicated than taking responsibility and stopping
        blaming others. Every second of the day they decide to read or to waste time. If their parents dragged them
        down, you can rightfully say that their parents didn't embrace radical responsibility and let everyone down,
        they view their children as a tool to cope with the meaningless life they have constructed themselves. Reading
        is free and so is wasting your time, at least in the moment. Later, not reading is going to become expensive,
        and wasting your time will be so expensive that 'unpayable' can't express it to its full extent. Someone may
        point to a meaningless motorbike accident, thinking that this will disprove the whole argumentation. But isn't
        it the case that this person chose to make a fatal turn, by being on the wrong point at the wrong time? Is it
        the fault of a person to be born in Africa? No, but they still decide how they are going to live their life,
        aren't there many successful and free individuals in Africa? And trying to point fingers in this situation does
        not help either. You must accept and adjust, by taking action, taking responsibility, and not by complaining.
        Perhaps I sounded as if I'm a cruel individual, full of spite of my own life, despite mastering everything I
        touch. Maybe. Perhaps sometimes it's nice to be comforted and to let your heart be melted. Perhaps sometimes
        empathy is vital, despite it being illogical. Yet, what I do is that a death by a thousand small cuts is much
        crueler than just standing up from the torture rack and refusing to remain passive, by embracing radical
        responsibility. Be butchered by the lies you keep telling yourself and others or stand up. Every time something
        good happens - thank God. Every time something bad happens - thank God for the lesson and stand up. You are
        free, as you've been given free will by God, and rejecting that offer is a sin. It's a sin to lie to yourself.
