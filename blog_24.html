        content="You may have heard of various methods to declutter your photo collection, but most are too general and don't offer real insights. However, I've got one tip that can make a difference. If you have a bunch of photos, try viewing them regularly and each time, aim to delete a few. But be warned! Viewing them too often might take away their magic and replace your actual memories with the photos themselves. So, the best advice is to create as few photos as possible. Quality over quantity, right?">

    <h1>Time to delete photos</h1>

    <p><em>Back in 2018, I found myself in my home country, capturing just four moments. These weren’t the most
            technically perfect shots, but they were the ones that held the most significance, the ones that expressed
            my story the best. When I look at them, I'm transported back to those long-gone moments.</em></p>

    <p>I don't know how you take photos, which hardware you use, or how often you take them. But I do know that quality
        matters more than quantity. Even if you take only a thousand pictures per year, the number compounds into tens
        of thousands over the years, which is too much to view. Thus, you take pictures without appreciating them ever
        again. Every unessential photo dilutes your story.</p>

    <p>Most photos are easy to delete. Most do not inspire positivity. Instead, they trigger annoyance and a profound
        sense of draining unrest. Some images are as unremarkably boring as stating that the sky is blue.</p>

    <p>What's the purpose of a photograph? It's not just a visual representation; it's a gateway to your memories. I
        remember driving from the airport into the city in a taxi at night at the beginning of my trip in 2018. The
        photo was taken at night, through a dotted taxi window, by no means a crystal-clear capture. To recall the
        drive, I only need one photo. That photo is a key that unlocks a treasure trove of other impressions I find
        pleasure in remembering. It's not just a photo; it's a portal to mystery and magic, a vessel of sweet nostalgia.
    </p>

    <p>Take control of your reality and fortify your mind. Photos are the bridges to our memories, so cut out the
        unpleasant ones. Do you want to remember that meme or screenshot? Do you want to keep all photos where you and
        your ex did something? Often, letting go is the best step forward, empowering you to curate your memories. </p>

    <p>Ordering your gallery establishes a greater sense of serenity in your soul. Decluttering your mind starts with
        your gallery.</p>

    <p>If you take photos, view them. While viewing and reexperiencing your story, discard the unessential ones and keep
        the ones that convey your story. Monumental sunsets are easy to remember, yet accidental photos capture unbound
        authenticity. The most unintentional images convey the deepest emotions.</p>

    <p>The choice is yours. I don’t recommend deleting every photo. I believe viewing your pictures while removing
        the unnecessary ones is a great pleasure. Enjoy your gallery.</p>

    <p><em>What's photography for?Capturing divine emotions and adventurous sights.
            When you think, “Moment, just linger; you are so beautiful,” you will surely make an unforgettable shot.
            Therefore, the greatest insight remains
            timeless.<br>Be present in the moment.</em></p>
