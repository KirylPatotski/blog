    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400">God has his favorites, are you one of them? </span></h1>

    <h1>Chosen by God </h1>

    <p><em>“I congratulate you for your perfect Abitur”</em>, with Abitur being the German name for ‘elite’ high school
        graduation. </p>

    <p><em>“I congratulate you too, you’ve got an even better graduation paper, seven points higher than mine, 830 out
            of 900 is your score.”</em>, I responded while remembering that I'm a spiritual teacher in my videos and
        simply need to relax, just like in a cold shower, while looking at her beautiful face. </p>

    <p><em> “Oh, Kiryl, 1.0 is 1.0, that’s what will be written on the graduation paper”</em>, only the top 0.6%-1% of
        students get a 1.0, and in this ‘elite’ school type 3% - 5%.</p>

    <p><em>“I feel a bit guilty; you know. I did nothing for it. While some people studied and genuinely gave
            their best, I didn’t. It’s not like I not only did not study, I focused on my stuff.”</em></p>

    <p>Some students cried on that day, and I felt even more guilty. One wanted to study medicine, for which you need a
        1.0 or a 1.1., unfortunately, her written history exam went poorly and thus her average dropped from 1.1 to 1.3.
        Dreams crushed. Out of 88 students in my grade, 12 had wasted two years of their lives because they failed the
        final exams or had too poor grades. And there I stood with a perfect result having done absolutely nothing for
        it.</p>

    <p>I, in fact, didn’t even know my grades and was positively surprised by the result. Retrospectively it seems
        obvious. For example, I knew that, for example in 11th grade I got my first grade 2 three months after the
        school year started, the German grading system ranging from 1 to 6, with 1 being the best. I also knew that I
        had 12 consecutive 1+ in 12th grade while having skipped 9th grade, without studying and with my mind far away.
        During the lessons, I wrote texts, read books, programmed, meditated, edited photos, and thought about hot
        girls, about one in particular, and still every teacher and student perceived me as the most brilliant and
        attentive student they’ve seen. Furthermore, that 12 consecutive 1+ period was in September, and let’s just say
        September 2023 was <em>mildly transformative</em> and <em>nothing</em> significant happened and I could fully
        focus <em>on school</em>.
    </p>

    <p>Altogether, that ‘not doing anything and still having perfect grades’ must have been truly extraordinary. …and
        ten minutes before the conversation from above, I didn’t know my grades. I somehow stopped documenting them and
        this whole Abitur stuff got too complicated for me, so I just focused on my business stuff again. I may sound
        like an asshole for bragging about how great I am, and that undeserved even, but it gets a lot worse. I'm not
        only ‘school smart’. I excel in many areas of life - and I did remarkably little for it.</p>

    <p>A year ago, I concluded that I must be the sexiest person in my small town. I don’t mean this arrogantly or
        sarcastically. I seem to excel at everything I try. I'm as romantic as a knight, writing brilliant love letters.
        I managed to compliment a 52-year-old to make him feel as if he is 35, I'm charming. I have a six-pack and
        simultaneously high levels of cardio. The contents of my diary are hard to match, I have stories to tell and
        live every day as if it's my last one, constantly redefining myself and leaning beyond my edge. I learn fast,
        you can tell me a thing once and I'll remember it for the rest of my life. Action, effort, and sacrifice do not
        scare me. My spirit is indomitable. I'm ambitious, tireless, and disciplined. Furthermore, I'm always as present
        as heaven is above earth. My extraordinary mind makes me a pleasure to chat with. My curiosity is sophisticated
        and my intellectual abilities are admired. I mean what I say, no one has to worry about ambiguity in my speech.
        I can say things others couldn’t without offending anyone, I even mastered speaking. I'm authentic in my words,
        actions, and desires. Loyalty also defines me, that without a comment. I never hesitate to express gratitude,
        love, or share joy. This list could go on… A year ago I concluded that I'm the sexiest person in my small town,
        so what's new? Now I can drive, cook (stopped in 2021 though), have a perfect Abitur, and now I even spend my
        time learning how to renovate. My mother, grandmother, and many of my low-status classmates mocked me for not
        knowing anything 'practical'. Even my former math teacher mocked me for skipping 9th grade while not knowing
        anything practical - and that started to change. In essence, I excel at everything I try. - I'm a feared
        opponent in any realm of human endeavor. No matter where you are right now, you have to fear me. </p>

    <p>Here is another example. In April 2024, while everyone else was busy studying for the Abitur, which was also in
        April, I trained for a mountain race of 8300 m length and a 220 m elevation gain. I trained approximately 15
        times in April, before that, I had run 10 km only 4 times in my life because I was going to the gym and found
        running boring. I trained decently hard. I scored 16th place out of 339 participants. One such participant was a
        classmate, he breathed with the leaves for his lungs, his blood was the streams and waterfalls and his heart was
        in the stones. He had trained running through the mountains for years. And then, I outdid him by a good chunk in
        the race. Imagine training for years and then being surpassed by someone who trained 15 times. A few weeks after
        the race, I effectively locked myself inside my room until I figured out how to finally get rid of my remaining
        stutters, enhance my videos, and make my voice deeper. A few short days later, I was done. I figured things
        out. Most don’t figure that out in a lifetime and here I was.</p>

    <p><em><strong>It seems God has his favorites.</strong></em> </p>

    <p>Are you one of God’s favorites? Maybe you are. Many people are. I’m not the only one blessed. Winning without
        trying is not possible without a blessing. That is objective reality. </p>

    <p>How can it be that some excel at everything they try? Some seem to glide through life like a surfboard on a wave
        while others constantly glide off the board and fall in the water, getting crushed by the waves. Someone may try
        ten times as hard and still fail. What does that mean to everyone who tries and still fails? What is even one’s
        achievement and which is someone else’s? What is the role of radical accountability when God has favorites? Why
        does God have favorites? </p>

    <p>I don’t have the answers. </p>

    <p>Yet, I can tell you very well that very little is truly my achievement. I didn’t choose to be born in the 21st
        century or any other century, for that matter. I didn’t choose to breathe fresh air, to have electricity, and to
        utilize technology to my advantage. I didn’t decide to get developed by my parents extensively which brought me
        years ahead and enabled me to sit down for ten hours straight until the work was done, maybe with one pushup-
        and toilet break. I didn’t choose to have everything aligned the way it did. I didn’t decide to become highly
        knowledgeable and for my resilience to know no bounds. </p>

    <p>What’s luck anyway? Luck is when preparation hits opportunity, Seneca, the stoic philosopher realized. What does
        being a God’s favorite mean then? Having and seeing more opportunities coupled with a greater capacity to
        prepare. </p>

    <p>My upbringing gave me a five-fold multiplier to my overall capacity, it is me who turned it into twenty-five.
        Indeed, I trained hard. I indeed dedicate my entire existence to becoming more attractive. Yet, I do not claim
        too much credit. The perfect graduation paper is remarkable, yet it does not matter. If I claimed credit, I
        would be arrogant. <em>“Let’s face it, on every metric I'm a supreme human being”</em>
        would attract negativity. Here's a little tip. Why did I not seem arrogant while writing about ‘my’
        achievements? Firstly, I stopped being arrogant a while ago, I learned my lesson. Secondly, I didn’t take
        credit. Not taking credit and blaming luck prevents envy, boosts your happiness, and enhances trustworthiness.
        Not taking credit also makes your life a lot less stressful, thus elevating life quality. </p>

    <p>Luck can run out – or increase for that matter. Hence, humility and gratitude. Do not take credit, give credit to
        others and your credit shall multiply on its own. Beacon patience with results, but speed in execution to
        establish your luck to counter the dragging forces of the universe. </p>

    <p>Many people are very, or at least moderately, lucky. Most are unlucky. Historically, practically everyone who
        ever existed was unlucky. Yet, most blessed people don’t utilize their luck. Some hot girls may go to parties,
        dye their hair, have male friends, and use social media and thus become non-marriage material, instead of using
        their attractiveness to find a knight and to raise competent children. Some random beta may decide it's better
        to be a geek who wastes time online over becoming a charismatic leader. Someone intelligent may study psychology
        or some other liberal arts. Someone may reach success and then celebrate a bit too much - thus losing their
        luck. Someone may see an opportunity right ahead and still miss it. Most people grow complacent. They stop
        reading, doing sports, eating healthy and live their life just sitting in the garden on a clear Sunday, eating
        cake. Consequently, they stop chasing dreams, take everything for granted, and stop hunting goals because their
        complacency finishes them. Their lives become a bit like a feather in the wind, which luckily for them lies on
        the <a href="blog_123.html">sunny parking lot</a> most of the time . As a last step, they stop having sex since
        being
        romantic is exhausting, being attractive requires effort, and doing nothing is relaxing. No matter at which
        level one is in life, one can always grow complacent and just give up. Complacency, referenced as sloth, is a
        cardinal sin by the way. If committing a cardinal sin does not imply losing one’s luck, I don’t know what does.
        Many sins indicate losing one’s luck, for example, excessive eating, pride, or lust. Yet, one sin is perhaps
        stronger. Giving up is the definition of wasting one’s luck. </p>


    <p>Hence, the best thing to do is use one’s luck to its fullest extent.</p>

    <p>An even better thing you can do with your luck is multiply everyone else's luck. Life gifts to you, and it is
        your duty to give your blessings away. Duty implies absolute responsibility, so, if you are unlucky, it’s still
        your responsibility to act. No matter where you are in life, you must hold absolute accountability. You are
        giving meaning to your life, if you take responsibility, give your best and use your luck. There’s no point in
        letting everything deteriorate. Your luck is pointless if you don’t use it. In the search for the meaning of
        life, the deepest realization is that life constitutes a test and you don’t want to fail said test. Everyone has
        their place in life and it is your duty to use your luck to enter the position you are supposed to take. If you
        are unlucky right now, things can change quickly. Furthermore, there’s a lot you can do to change how blessed
        you want to be. I don’t believe that someone indefatigable, humble, curious, attentive, courageous, and fast can
        fail in a long enough time frame. And remember, everything has a price. There’s a price of being lucky, you get
        a lot more responsibility. With greater capacity comes greater sacrifice. Such is the way of duty, gifts, and
        being blessed.</p>
