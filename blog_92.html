    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Ask yourself, what's the biggest thing holding me back right now.</span></h1>

    <h1>Discipline forever</h1>

    <p>I used to have higher discipline for months on end, where I didn't listen to music or touch sweets while removing
        every bad habit I could think of and living with healthy habits. This raises the obvious question, higher in
        comparison to whom? In comparison to myself in October, where some bad habits returned that I fought years ago
        and already considered defeated. In late September, I had 3 months of monk mode behind me: 10 days of the
        extreme variant at the beginning, and then 1.5 more months of slightly less extreme monk mode. I felt amazing.
        After September came October, when my life got significantly worse because my discipline faded, and I decided to
        restart extreme monk mode again. </p>

    <p>After a few days of extreme and then light monk mode, starting on 26.10.2023, I was able to restore higher
        discipline and kept it on a higher level when I entered light monk mode. My creativity and mental clarity
        returned after 2 days of extreme monk mode, and that's why I stopped it. I wrote a lot since then, but I read,
        listened to music, and watched YouTube. Today I put out my diary and realized, that I had exited extreme monk
        mode too early. I felt a lot better, but I didn't have enough life-changing insights. Today I got up early
        again, it is Monday the 6th of November and I decided to restart with extreme monk mode for at least 10 days,
        until Thursday, the 16th of November. Having watched YouTube, I saw videos similar to the content I'm producing
        here, hence I got confronted with new questions, ones which will change my life forever and I'm going to think
        about them for the next while. I left myself alone with my thoughts, I thought about these questions and saw the
        answers.</p>

    <p><strong><em>What's the biggest thing holding me back right now, that I could change?</em></strong></p>

    <p>Often less is more and I let go of many things, never did I regret letting go. Recently I let go of learning
        Chinese for example as well as my mental math app.</p>

    <p><strong><em>School perhaps isn't useless.</em></strong> It's easy to blame the school for holding me back, yet
        the damage was nonexistent and after a few months of living right I learned that. I made no less progress while
        going to school in comparison to being at home for months during the summer holidays. Besides, I'm part of the
        system, hence school is necessary. My parent and I often fought about whether university was necessary because
        every successful person my parents or I spoke to in person insisted that this was no longer the case. “I went to
        university, quit, and started to work before I created my own business,” said the millionaire I had an
        internship with, who got rich via software. Successful people on the internet say the same things, but only
        because it's useful to get jobs with. Hence, it is outside of my control and I never care about things outside
        of my control. “Do you want a boy or a girl,” my grandmother asked me a few days ago. “That's outside my sphere
        of influence, therefore, I don't care.” </p>

    <p><strong><em>Fear of too sudden progress.</em></strong> “You have asked out that girl, why don't you make the
        second move” is the all-encompassing phrase. There are many facets to this negative trait it's transcending
        every aspect of my life. After making great progress this spring, around 50 failures accumulated, and some of
        them seemed to be critical, which was proven correct in September. This means I got punished for moving too fast
        and I haven't recovered yet. I tried to give insights on how I will remove this fear a month ago in the text
        “Laying a solid foundation,” where consistency and plans will help me to overcome this fear. Another aspect of
        this fear is the fear of committing to apprenticeships, or internships, as I had 2 this year and learned very
        little, I only used the knowledge already in my inventory, hence the fulfillment was missing. Going to events is
        another thing I neglect, as well as connecting myself. The worst aspect of this fear is that it's holding me
        back from making compounding progress with my YouTube channel. Another facet of this fear is seen in the story
        “Failures kill”, which goes has one key message “I failed and built-up fear as a result” It took 6 months to
        recover, since it showed a missing foundation. Then, I failed even harder. In every other case, it's going to
        take months to conquer this fear once and for all.</p>

    <p><strong><em>4 a.m. YouTube.</em></strong> I started to get up at 4 a few weeks ago
        and noticed it's a bad habit because often I'm only half awake and need 20 minutes to get fully focused. That
        means, it's already 4:20 and there isn't much time until 6:20 when I will have to start getting ready for
        school, which starts 1 hour apart. Getting up at 3:30 is unnatural, yet incomparably better. Half an hour of
        focused time extra is a true gift. “Will it wake you up, if I start talking at 4 in the morning?” I asked my
        mother and she responded with yes and I learned this concern was an assumption to be wrong. Factually, some
        videos had been recorded at 22:00 and no one heard anything, so I projected my weakness onto a to-be-proven
        wrong statement. I wanted to get up at 4 for YouTube in the first place, as it would give me enough time to
        record and edit a video or to write a script. Now, I have an inconsistency, harmful to my health: if I have
        nothing to do, I sleep through and only get up at 4:30, this fluctuation of 1 hour is something I will let go of
        too.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Working in bed.</em></strong> Discipline is doing the right things, especially when you don't feel
        like it. I let go of working in bed a couple of days ago, I enjoyed the comfort, yet it made me weak. That's an
        easy sacrifice to make, demonstrating the power of the question: “What's the biggest thing holding me back right
        now?” Sometimes, it's the little things holding you back.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Missing routine.</em></strong> How am I going to become consistent with YouTube, reading poetry as
        well as reading in Russian, and reading in general, if I don't have a routine for it? I have enough time in the
        morning for all of these things, yet I never executed this idea and never created a new schedule in the first
        place. You know what, I'm going to this right here and right now, I've waited enough.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Routine in the wrong places.</em></strong> Now, I got sick, but before I got sick, I went to the gym
        at the same time and walked at the same time too, and this turned out to be suboptimal, as it often interrupted
        my work. I would not start working at 15:30, if I knew I would be going to the gym at 16:00, wasting 30 minutes.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Not digging for gold.</em></strong> I know that I should be reading a lot more, yet reading on a
        computer never brings me into a flow. I should be reading 1 book per week, and I hold the self-limiting belief
        that spending 1000€ on books is too expensive.</p>

    <p><strong><em>If I'm unable to stay disciplined at home in my room, where will I be?</em></strong>

    <p>“Yes, I can relate to this, while I hate vacations, I'm always undisciplined there,” said a girl recently and I
        responded with “No, this doesn't have to be, while in Barcelona, I stayed disciplined, it was only Turkey a few
        months later where I suffered of bad habits” I advise against traveling without a purpose.</p>

    <p><em>“So, completely hungry and exhausted we drove back from Barcelona 1 hour to our hotel via train, the train
            was crowded and we had to stand. The train tracks were parallel to the beach and the world was in golden
            light. There it hit me - vacations with all their relaxation, idleness and abundance force you into a
            meaningless and purposeless existence.” - Statement after Barcelona, blog #25</em></p>

    <p>During vacations, you are in a liminal state, which makes it nearly impossible to stay disciplined. People like
        athletes or millionaires, who are more disciplined than any of us, also suffer from this, because discipline is
        tied to a specific habitat, for most people it's not the apartment in London, but their old room in their
        parent's house. </p>

    <p><em>“Almost a month has passed, today is the 25th of August. During this vacation [in Barcelona], I resisted any
            bad habits. [...] This is a very powerful lesson, invisible at first, because it means, that I can stand
            true to my values even if there are massive temptations everywhere. Because everything applies to anything,
            it should be clear that not cheating on yourself in tempting circumstances will result in you not cheating
            on others in any circumstances.”</em></p>

    <p>Contrast this with the weakness seen just a couple of months later in Turkey.</p>

    <p><em>“Then in Turkey, where I had been just 15 hours after I came back from Venice, I continued. I ate sugar after
            every meal. Yet, in Turkey, […] the negatives hadn't been compounded yet, and my existence was also liminal,
            therefore negativity only struck me as I returned. I felt similar to June, where I would do simply nothing,
            except with some more negative additions such as bad habits, exhaustion, no goal, and depressing darkness,
            post-Indian summer. There were some sparks of hope, especially at the beginning.”</em></p>

    <p>There's a problem beneath the surface, creating a card house ready to collapse. Successful people are unable to
        stay disciplined in the presence of liminality and irresistible temptations, and I was partially unable to stay
        disciplined even in the right environment. I have a lot longer to go…</p>

    <p>However, slipbacks are part of progress. I lived right for 6 months, then I slipped back partially, and now I'm
        ready for an even longer period of more discipline. Potentially, this period will last 5 years. By thinking that
        it will last 5 years, I'm changing my identity and partly manifesting the truth. I hope I won't get humbled
        again.</p>

    <p><strong><em>The temptations will increase, and I'm fighting with music sacrifice.</em></strong>

    <p>Music isn't a bad habit, but it gives something to practice sacrifice and resisting temptations with. There is a
        high chance, I'm going to destroy myself, as every person except the 1% of 1% falls deep after achieving
        success. There is no doubt that I will get successful, but there is rightful doubt stay successful because it
        rarely happens. I don't know if I will be able to resist every temptation life throws at me, so far, I had no
        problems, but the current temptations are trash, they keep getting better with higher levels of success. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Does it make sense to pursue a serious relationship in my current situation?</em></strong>

    <p>There is no doubt that love is necessary, and staying with your high school sweetheart is axiomatically better if
        it's the right one for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it removes some of the later temptations, adds more
        certainty, and allows for more progress to be made, because it no longer becomes a priority, you will think
        about it anyway, and finally, the bond is going to be better since success won't be a metric. This will create
        greater discipline and can make the difference between the 1% and the 0.01% </p>

    <p>This comes at multiple great risks. If it's not the right one, you waste time during your youth, when every day
        makes a difference because of the compound effect. This gets countered by the question of what immense wealth is
        necessary for in the first place. Additionally, since you are young, you may not see obvious red flags, because
        you lack experience. It could go on forever, that's why here are some final observations: everyone will show red
        flags, even if those are visible months later, so the differences aren't too large. Having lived in a little
        ruined town in Germany and the Belarusian metropolis Minsk, there are no differences, because the differences
        depend on you.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of the old man on his deathbed, this question can't be answered, because you can never view
        into the future. I would say, in my specific situation, the answer is yes. Hoping, I won't get humbled here
        again.</p>

    <p><strong><em>How much does my baseline need to get lifted?</em></strong>

    <p>Periods of extreme discipline always elevate the baseline to a level that transforms lives and makes permanent
        discipline easier. Hence, the wise general disciplines his soldiers to a level, where the battle seems easier in
        comparison. Going to the gym isn't discipline and neither is getting up at 3:30. Discipline isn't about healthy
        habits, but rather doing the right things, especially if you don't feel like it. You need to remind yourself
        constantly, otherwise, you will grow arrogant and prevent further progress. Lying in bed after realizing it's a
        bad habit and not fixing it is progress prevented. Imagine having stopped improving one year ago. Change your
        identity to a constant student. To cite Sun Tzu, an ancient Chinese philosopher, from his chef-d'oeuvre “The Art
        of War”: </p>

    <p><em>“The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is
            to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom. […] To lift an
            autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the
            noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only
            wins but excels in winning with ease. Hence his victories bring him neither a reputation for wisdom nor
            credit for courage. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the
            certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.” </em></p>


    <p><strong><em>What's the essence of self-improvement?</em></strong>

    <p>It's to find weak points and turn them into strong points before it's too late. It's about being a lifelong
        student and constantly redefining yourself.</p>
