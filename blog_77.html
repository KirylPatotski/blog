  <h1>Negatives of the mind</h1>

  <p>I think this guide will prove valuable to you, but hard to implement, although it's worth it because your mind
    follows your every move. </p>

  <p>Before we start with the guide, let me explain what I'm referring to with it. “Negatives of the mind” doesn't refer
    to negative emotions such as fear, anger, nervousness, or sadness. Those are natural and necessary, just as rain.
    Some of them can even be reframed, for instance, nervousness feels just like excitement. You aren't nervous to
    present something, you are excited! Negatives of the mind refer to insecurities, stress, procrastination, worries,
    addictions, anxiety, or depression. They are unemotional, which means, you can still worry about something while
    taking a bath, long-lasting and therefore less intense. That means, stress because your train arrives in 5 minutes
    isn't 100% a negative of the mind, but rather an emotion.</p>

  <p>Now, at first, you will learn why your mind is based on the environment, how to fix your environment, how to fix
    yourself, and how to advance further. You may think that it's not worth it or that it may not work for you. Let me
    tell you, your mind is the only thing in the world you can gain entire control over and you should do it. Only if
    you gain control of your mind, you will be able to live life properly. You don't want to have some random negative
    of the mind in an intimate moment, do you? Stop believing you aren't in control, if you aren't, who is? Take
    responsibility, radical responsibility, and fight through this guide. Your thoughts may be against you at this very
    moment. Trying to say that it doesn't work. Well, those aren't actually your thoughts, it's just the same loud voice
    telling you to have bad habits, only the quieter voice in your head that knows the truth. You will need to fight,
    stay disciplined, and drain your willpower multiple times in that process, are you ready?</p>

  <h1>You are part of the universe</h1>

  <p>Life on a fundamental level is automated chemistry, simple molecules doing something. They are made out of ordered
    energy, such as <em>directed</em> light, and unordered and useless, <em>directionless</em> warmth as a result. The
    difference in
    energetic levels is always zero, but the amount of order and disorder isn't. Life creates more disorder than order.
    In a physics context, this phenomenon is called entropy. That means, if you have an apple in an ant colony, the ant
    colony will make the ordered apple into less ordered chemicals, meaning those resulting chemicals won't be as useful
    for other organisms. Therefore, life steals low entropy (=order, concentrated energy and matter) and turns it into
    high entropy, meaning, it spreads it and makes warmth spreading in every direction instead of just one, therefore it
    becomes useless for all the other organisms. To an extent, it means, that low-level life such as microbes,
    mushrooms, plants, single cellars, and viruses especially, are insofar part of the universe directly. Talking about
    entropy, only the difference in entropy matters: 2 different liquids have a low entropy when separated, and maximum
    entropy when mixed, yet only in the brief moments these liquids get mixed, do they create interesting patterns.
    These patterns emerge on their own, too complex to be predicated even by the most powerful computers, and are a
    simple form of life, therefore, because these patterns are interesting and automatic. The only difference is that
    they don't sustain themselves, because it ends when the liquids are mixed.</p>

  <p>Now you may be tempted to doubt the application of this explanation for this guide, where I teach how to get rid of
    the mind's negatives. Trust me, it will all make sense now, just wait a few more paragraphs.</p>

  <p>As I explained, low-level life is automated chemistry, it just transforms focused energy and matter into spread-out
    energy and matter. Therefore, it is free of any freedom, will, destiny, mind, or thought but is rather completely
    dependent on chemistry, physics, and math. That means, there is no separation between the universe and low-level
    life and it can be viewed as a unity.</p>

  <p>Now, let's look at high-level life. Fundamentally, you are doing the same things right now as the lower forms of
    life, but with a slight difference: consciousness. What does consciousness do? It provides you with the ability to
    choose what to do to some extent, and it gives you the mind and with it, some levels of autonomy to create what you
    desire. With this freedom, comes morality, religion, culture, and many more things irrelevant to this text.</p>

  <p>But what's important is that your consciousness can extend itself beyond your body, especially your brain, beyond
    just automated chemistry. That means, the little calculator, phone, notebook, camera, and every other touchable
    object that you interact with becomes part of your universe, and by extension part of your consciousness. Your mind
    isn't limited to your brain, rather, objects extend it. Objects that you spend a lot of time with also become
    indirectly connected to your nervous system as well, as a rule of thumb, the significance of an object increases if
    you spend more time with it or use it more. That's why it hurts to lose some objects, relics of the past or the
    present. </p>

  <p>Your mind is the tool to understand and interact with the world and can't be separated from the environment. That
    means, your mind adds a layer between just the universe and simple life forms, yet is still dependent on it.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <h1>The most potent tip</h1>

  <p>So here is the first and most powerful tip, which will have the highest return on investment if you haven't
    implemented it. Remove objects that extend negative aspects of your mind or harm you in general. In most cases,
    social media, the internet, adult entertainment, or video games, do the most harm, as they negatively extend your
    mind. It's more useful to imagine the internet to be an infinite dark tight hole, dragging your consciousness down
    through your small phone.</p>

  <p>The most important tip is already marked: don't waste your time on the internet, because the internet destroys the
    mind, by extending the negative parts. But it's not clear how exactly that's the case, right? Here is how it works.
    At first, your consciousness develops with the help of your environment, which happens until around the age of 4,
    after it, children can think, (although I doubt that, most adults don't even think). But this shaping of
    consciousness doesn't stop after the age of 4, instead, it continues forever. By a process called learning the brain
    constantly rewires itself. Sometimes objects replace these wires, for example, a calculator effectively replaces
    parts of the brain responsible for mental math. Instead, the brain learns how to use the calculator as effortlessly
    as possible, which means it saves the location rather than the action, therefore, your calculator becomes part of
    your mind. So, be careful what you spend time with, and what you pay attention to, otherwise it may become deeply
    wired into your psyche. If you pay attention to something, it stays in your mind, it becomes your reality for a
    brief moment. That's bad if the attention is wasted on entertainment, lust, or useless content, your reality
    corrupts and mental suffering is the result. That's what ads (or how they used to be called: propaganda) are in the
    first place: desperate attempts to occupy your reality by stealing your attention.</p>

  <p>It's generally recommended to cut down content consumption and to turn up content production for your mental
    health. You may think that you need social media. I live without a phone and I'm better off than everyone, so trust
    me, this whole internet nonsense isn't necessary. Consume less, consuming too much is unnatural. It's OK, good and
    healthy to be bored. <em>Boredom accelerates.</em> You already knew it. You knew that writing such a text as I'm
    doing
    right now, would feel very relaxing. I have written nothing for a week, you can kind of feel this, because of the
    complexity and quality of this text, I feel like writing has become a necessity. </p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>By the way, other people can extend your consciousness too, in the same way as objects. In this case, the nervous
    system, synchronizes (called bonding) and it's unfortunately rare nowadays, that's why I started with objects. If
    the nervous systems don't synchronize, because your relationship isn't too intimate, weaker forms of this phenomenon
    exist too, they are called (although they all slightly differ): “family”, “tribe”, “group identity”, “people”,
    “culture”, “the mass”, “group” and “collective mind” That means, you should stop spending time with harmful,
    negative, stupid, lazy and undisciplined people, especially, if they represent or cause negatives of the mind, or
    are visibly infected with them. Please don't think you can help and save them; you have to save yourself first and
    you are not Jesus. These people need to find the need themselves.</p>

  <p>If your mind uses objects to extend itself, then you are part of your environment. The simpler forms of life, such
    as cells, are not a part of their environment, but rather their environment themselves, because they are missing
    consciousness, a mind, and a soul. </p>

  <p>That means, before you can fix your mind itself, and remove any negatives of it, you must modify your environment.
    So, the first steps will be all about your environment, and if you fix them, you will be already 90% there. If you
    apply every other hint as well, you will reach 150% happiness. </p>

  <h1>The environment (external)</h1>

  <p>The environment, the universe, the world, however you may call it. Since 1915, the General Theory of Relativity by
    Einstein, we all know, that time is an integral part of the environment as well as the physical location. The
    environment changes and is complex. Here are some tips to follow to remove negatives of the mind:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Beauty</li>

    <p>I know it sounds strange, but that's one of the things you won't hear about anywhere, yet at the same time, it's
      one of the best tips. Would you rather live in a depressing city or a lovely village? While you may be tempted to
      live in a city because you can party there (?) or for whatever reason, I would strongly advise against it.
      Probably the reason you live in a city wasn't an authentic decision in the first place, instead, it was most
      likely a silly reason at its core and justified by logic. For example, you may want to go to parties. Therefore,
      you cope by saying there are great jobs in cities. But you can be a doctor in a village too! Unless this city is
      very pretty, for example, Minsk, Hamburg or Vienna. </p>

    <p>Europa is generally considered to look very aesthetic. But, it's impossible to be happy if there is ugliness,
      darkness, and trash everywhere you look. Can you be happy in stinking public transit with dirty plastic bags
      flying around in loudness? Now you may be living in a poor and ugly country. I don't know how much you can change
      that, but still, your surroundings must be pretty, pleasing to the eye, and esthetic. Would you feel better in a
      hospital with rounded corners, lime walls, and a yellow floor with painted flowers or rather in a grey and white
      hospital? Turns out, thoughtful and pretty design “made with love” makes people happier and heal better. </p>

    <p>A messy room… You can already think of the rest.</p>

    <p>Pretty things are often expensive, are they worth it? Yes, it's better to have a trash can than a plastic bag
      lying in the corner of the kitchen. Buy only items you could photograph, otherwise don't buy them at all - design
      is part of utility. Don't buy items of low quality in general. Do you think you will ever regret buying something
      of high quality, utility, design, and longevity?</p>

    <p>Beauty also applies to you, to some extent. No one likes to look at fat, ugly, sick, or disabled people and
      neither do you. You need to please others with your appearance. You may think that making your hair or nails will
      help. It won't have a large impact, going to the gym does. Your teeth are one of the most important assets in your
      face. Now, going to the gym, looking fit, and having a great posture are not entirely related to beauty, but they
      are still more potent than making your hair, which is directly related to beauty, because, making your hair takes
      10 minutes, and going to the gym 5 hours per week. </p>

    <p>Now you may be asking why being pretty removes negatives from the mind and makes you happy. Simple: people treat
      you better, and as a result, you perceive yourself differently too, and start to be happier. As a result, people
      will treat you even better, because you are pretty and happy! This phenomenon is called the looking-glass self.
      You have to be upright with your shoulders back moving elegantly with a trained body and mind. You won't feel
      insecure, because others will for you!</p>

    <p>Now, do I think I'm pretty? Yes, I think it and I am! If you know that others find you pretty, or if you have
      manipulated yourself hard enough into thinking so, people will treat you accordingly. If you are truly a grey swan
      (=ugly) you shouldn't try to convince yourself, as this will be incoherent with your inner thoughts and cause
      unhappiness.</p>

    <p>One of my first YouTube videos tells this story. As I started to create cinematic videos in 2021, I started to
      view the world differently, because I conditioned myself to do so. I started to look at things and thought about
      how they would look in a timelapse, that means, if the sky was depressing, I looked at the distant and small strip
      of golden evening sky. It made me look at pretty things automatically and was an immense improvement to my
      well-being. As I'm writing this another little story happened yesterday. I was on a castle in Alanya, Turkey, and
      the path had walls on the right side and a scenery of mountains, houses, and the sea, all covered in the
      low-standing sun. The way was bordered by little stones stacked to create little walls. In such grey stone walls,
      I saw a little flower, no bigger than 2cm, a majestical, cute flower and I was the only one to spot it because I
      trained myself to.</p>


    <li>Nature</li>

    <p>Nature is pretty too and nature isn't urban too. It's unnatural to live in cities and people in cities suffer
      mentally more in general, also because nature is missing, because of too many crowds, too much pollution, poor air
      quality, trash, stinking air, “street art”, ugly buildings, ugly cars, ugly people, noise, asphalt, concrete, ads,
      missing sunlight, traffic and a constant stream of strangers.</p>

    <p>Your mind isn't built for that kind of environment. It's simply too much negativity and it's almost impossible to
      take great photos in cities except if you try to capture that “dystopian” feeling in a black and white photo. In
      general, all city photos show how busy, extravagant, depressive, dystopian, or colorful it is, all of them are put
      to their extreme.</p>

    <p>Your mind is built for 2 hour walks a day instead. I walk every day around the lake, for 10km. Sometimes it's
      raining and the sun shines, and I take great photos. It's impossible to be depressed if the light is turning from
      golden to violet and eventually fading to navy, while you are looking at the sunset reflecting in the water. </p>

    <li>Health</li>

    <p>Your sleep habits (=time), and what you consume, both food and content shape your mind. I observed, that eating
      sugar is bad for the mind and alcohol destroys it. Obviously, processed food is bad for your health and by
      extension your mind, because your body is part of your mind's environment. It's all connected. </p>

    <p>Going to the gym, sleeping well, meditating, resting, and being active, hot and cold exposure are all excellent
      for you and already well known. As someone who does each of these things, I noticed the greatest impact to come
      from chemicals. You must stop/avoid using too many chemicals, creams, or hard medicines. (I know some people who
      take painkillers (=opioids) for very little pain already in huge doses or others taking strong hormones,
      especially women, instead of fixing their life. Please don't try to argue, you don't need drugs to fall asleep, to
      soften the pain, or to get your mind in order. You need to fix your life first.) Those are extreme, but unfortunately common,
      examples and quite obvious, here are foods I found to be harmful to my men's health. Sugars, corn, soy, milk,
      seeds and their oils, palm fat, and oil, and coconut products. Almost everything is harmful to eat, because of its
      low quality and cheap ingredients, fortunately, 90% of it can be avoided if you primarily buy single or
      double-ingredient foods. For example, you can see if something contains corn or if it contains some weird
      chemicals. Fixing my life and eating healthy had little impact on my male health, the single greatest improvement
      came after I stopped using plastic bottles, containers, plates, cutting utensils, and other things made out of
      plastic, as plastic releases hormones, just as seeds. That means, my health improved further as I stopped
      consuming things fried in sunflower or corn oil and used butter to fry instead, or simply the microwave. Plastics
      in particular damage by releasing hormones, estrogenic ones, and they are harmful for men, because of their
      immensely increased concentration and because they trick your body into behaving like the body of a woman. Again,
      just like the mind's negatives in general, if something doesn't go the way it's supposed to, it creates suffering.
      I used to not know what damage these chemicals do to men, but the effects are quite visible: tits and obesity. As
      I'm in Turkey on vacation right now, I see fat 6-year-old boys with tits already. That's not the way it's supposed
      to be. With these come feminine character traits, which aren't natural for men either. If you are fat and weak,
      because you drink from a plastic bottle, other people will treat you accordingly.</p>

    <li>People</li>

    <p>As already mentioned in the previous blogs and this blog as well, people are essential to your happiness, but not
      losers, <a href="blog_28.html"> <em>stay away from them</em></a>. </p>

    <p>Of course, you have to build social skills. But surprisingly social skills and interaction are necessary to be
      happy (if you are very individual). Similar to the point of nature, it's unnatural to live in a city, because
      community is missing, and it's unnatural to be lonely. Again, it's impossible to feel depressed if you have people
      you can trust, relate to, and have fun with. </p>

    <p>The right woman is essential to your happiness too, as well as love in general. Community and family, God and
      romantic love.</p>

    <p>However, the right people are rare. How can you find them? By being one. What can help? Well, that's where we
      move from the environment, the external to the external individual. </p>
  </ol>

  <h1>Your life (external individual)</h1>

  <p>After you have changed your environment, and improved it, it's time for changes regarding your personal life. </p>

  <p>Where do the mind's negatives come from? Insecurities show what you are missing. Worries about something you don't
    know, stress about something you should have done, and fear showing you where you are weak. In general, the
    negatives of the mind show what's wrong and what needs to be fixed, for example, I worry if I know I should have
    done something and didn't do it.</p>

  <p>Before you advance further you must “compensate” by improving your personal life. You are not a Buddhist monk who
    got rid of any worldly desires, that's why you need to do it first. Almost every blog of mine explains what you
    should do and how to live. Here is an outline.</p>



  <ul>

  </ul>

  <p>In short: get strong, as a strong life creates a strong mind and a strong mind doesn't have weak thoughts. Do what
    you know you are supposed to and negatives will have no space to appear. Remember the beginning of the text? Your
    mind can't be separated from your surroundings. A fixed life will bring you almost to absolute happiness, and the
    principles covered next will lead to permanently increased happiness (in comparison to others, you won't notice it,
    because you will forget how your life used to be).</p>

  <p>Practical measures: gym, cold showers, no sugar, no idle time, focus, a goal to work towards. But, you already knew
    them ;-)</p>

  <p>This section which explains that you need to get strong applies to men only, as I don't think women should
    challenge themselves, get competent, or take radical responsibility. Because going against your nature results in
    immense mental suffering. If you know that you should have done something and knowingly didn't do it, that's where
    regret comes from. The same thing applies here. Don't manipulate yourself into modern ideology. </p>

  <p>This principle of following your role isn't limited to genders either. If you are a teacher, don't try to run a
    factory. You are just not the right person for it. If your work/task isn't fulfilling, important, or simply right
    enough for you, it will cause negatives in the mind as well. The right work must lead to a flow state, one where it
    becomes kind of fun to work and time passes very fast. It will feel effortless. Just like a ballerina doesn't try to
    imitate a dance, she becomes the dance. It's not plausible to pick work that doesn't have the potential to bring you
    into a flow. I must admit that some work will bring you into a flow if it's hard enough and you are good enough at
    it. That's another reason why competence is important. Programming won't bring you into a flow, it will just be
    exhausting until you master it. Then it becomes fun. </p>

  <p>You should have no free time in the classical sense if free time means mindless consumption (=bad habit time). Your
    ideal life certainly doesn't include time in a state of mental and physical fatigue, mental absence, and passive
    consumption. This doesn't happen if you pick the right work and the right rest. If your work is great enough, you
    will work even in your “free time” because you will enjoy it. If you get exhausted, you go for a walk. There is no
    passivity involved. Let's pick an example of having no goal, no focus, and a mind that goes anywhere. Those
    situations are for example traffic or standing in line. Do you like those activities? No, because your mind has
    nothing to do, and therefore creates negative thoughts, to keep you entertained, as explained in the text “<a
      href="blog_55.html">The
      work-life balance lie</a> ” and “<a href="blog_70.html">Desperate awakening</a>”</p>

  <p>A strong vision and goal are necessary for you to advance because it will give your mind something positive to
    occupy itself with. Your current goal isn't the final one and that's ok. I spent one year with my mind being
    occupied with my apps. Of course, my app already died, so I will have to find a new one. Your goal is something only
    you know, you have to find it, even if it takes a while, but again, stare at a wall and turn everything off, until
    you find it. </p>

  <p>You can change your role and identity with it. For example, if I identify as a teacher, it feels better to practice
    talking or writing. If you identify as an athlete, of course, you are going to eat healthily and get up at 5! You
    can have many identities at the same time, for example, I'm an entrepreneur, teacher (=writing + talking + videos),
    athlete, photographer, mathematician, philosopher, and many smaller identities. However, these new identities/roles
    should be in line with your nature. I can't identify as a girl for example. Changing your identity is painful, makes
    you look stupid, and creates a temporary whole, yet is still necessary. Move on with your current identity and
    inaction and get the identity of a person improving him/herself. If you change your identity to a better one, the
    change back will be hard too, this time this effect will help you to stay at a higher level.</p>

  <p>My main identity is that of a fighter. I try hard everywhere and give my absolute best, and a fighter is fast,
    precise, maneuverable, and feared.</p>

  <h1>Your mind (internal individual)</h1>

  <p>Here is where it gets interesting. Normally, you are already done. You have created a strong body, mind, and
    environment, have a pretty room, no bad habits, no distractions and you have gotten rid of almost every negative of
    the mind. But sometimes you will still be strange… You won't directly suffer, but sometimes you will “just not feel
    so good”<br>
    You may be sitting at the sunset in a little café on top of a mountain looking down to the sea and be unhappy.
    Others may validate you and you will feel as if they are lying. You may have material success and still have
    negatives of the mind, still worry about some useless crap. You may see someone more muscular and feel as if you
    should train harder. Everything may still feel useless. Maybe you will as if you don't deserve anything and that
    everything is going to crumble in the future, destroying you in the process, while still sitting at the little café
    on top of a mountain… The dinner ends soon and what was it for? It's all meaningless.
  </p>

  <p>But then at the same romantic café, something happened that never did before. You suddenly feel awake, as if you
    have been asleep your whole life prior. You wake up, consciousness struck from above and everything starts to feel
    vivid. You realize that everything has been meaningless and that's all right. You have simply a life, you are alive.
    You realize what's real and what isn't, and the negatives aren't real.</p>

  <p>Later on, that day you start to write in a journal for the first time, you take out pen and paper in your aesthetic
    room and write about life. Entirely authentic and for yourself. You bring your thoughts into the physical realm. You
    start to assess everything you believed to be true, your opinions, everything you worried about, everything you
    wanted to see, everything you <a href="blog_33.html">desired</a> … </p>

  <p>Soon you move on with your <a href="blog_63.html">traumas</a> by writing about them and realizing how “silly” they
    were. A ritual will set you
    free from them. Then your mind becomes free because you know that you left the past. You also change your
    environment and appearance again; I replaced my necklace with a metal chain in September and started to <em>make my
      hair</em> in March. In the same way, you <a href="blog_80.html">get rid of old regrets</a> and position them as
    memorial obelisk in your
    mind.</p>

  <p>You will also learn, that gratitude is the key to fulfillment and happiness because it removes negatives from the
    mind. Let's say you pray or write down things you are grateful for. Soon, these thoughts of gratitude will pop into
    your mind randomly and remind you to be grateful. Gratitude is from a scientific perspective the cure for
    depression, although achievement and gratitude are often interconnected with each other. That means if you to the
    gym and build a great body, you will be grateful for it. This will add meaning and fulfillment to your life. Then,
    when you start to pray or/and to a gratitude journal, this gratitude, will replace the negative thoughts. </p>

  <p>You also start to meditate regularly in combination with journaling to repeat the experiences of that day. You
    learn about flow, conciseness, awakening, mental offline and online, and how everything starts to make sense. </p>

  <p>Slowly, you start to truly transform and your happiness becomes omnipresent. Negatives of the mind drop to an
    insignificant level. Now, when you are lying in bed, no dark thoughts appear and you start to sleep very well.</p>

  <h1>Spirituality</h1>

  <p>Now you have everything? You have a beautiful environment, time in nature, people by your side, respect from
    others, material wealth, success, respect, health, a fixed mind, and simply everything one can desire. Now you don't
    even want anything more.</p>

  <p>Things at this level remove your mind and you become part of the universe again, just as the automated chemistry,
    but with a conciseness. You realize that your mind needs to be fixed, but ultimately, your mind was just a bridge,
    and now you crossed the river.</p>


  <p>Thoughts, emotions, desires, and fears were all a product of the mind which in turn was a product of the
    environment, by now you get rid of these connections and start to become spiritual. Sparks of absolute
    consciousness, flow, God, enlightenment, and the infinite intelligence become relevant and everything else fades
    into insignificance. You reach the highest level, fortunately, an infinite one. This level will make you busy for
    the rest of your life.</p>

  <p>Most people grossly overestimate their knowledge of spirituality and how conscious they are. For example, every
    time you catch yourself taking shallow breaths, not standing upright, or being ungrateful, you know that you have
    been mentally absent for a few minutes or even hours. Take deep breaths and remind yourself of them. Write it on a
    little piece of paper and put it somewhere you can see it all the time. <a href="blog_25.html">Breathe like a king.</a></p>

  <p>Congratulations, you are now the universe, you are enlightened and part of the infinite intelligence.</p>

  <h1>For what?</h1>

  <p>Why should you attempt to fix your mind in the first place and even prioritize it? Because it is your reality. Your
    reality is defined as the thing you perceive in the world, so you must change it to a better one. If you haven't
    fixed your mind, you experience levels of suffering unimaginable to your future self. </p>

  <p>On the other hand, some people, exceptionally rare, like Stephen Hawking could separate their mind from their
    environment entirely and break free. Spirituality will help you to do the same, but only under the condition that
    you experience everything else first, otherwise, it will be much less meaningful. How will you be supposed to know
    anything, if your life is a mess? The default should be a fixed life, from then on you can advance further. The
    improvement of your life works much better, if you have strong goals, even if they are worldly.</p>

  <h1>Summay</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Negatives of the mind
      <ul>
        <li>Not emotions, as those can be good, necessary (like rain), or reframed (excitement, not nervousness)</li>
        <li>Annoying, long-lasting, mildly intense things such as worries, stress, procrastination, addiction,
          insecurities…</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      You are part of the universe
      <ul>
        <li>Simple forms of life have no will, they just exist, although they do something: they create entropy.
          Therefore, simple forms of life are a part of their environment.</li>
        <li>You are conscious, but still your mind is in huge parts not separatable from the environment. Therefore, the
          biggest changes towards removing negatives of the mind come from the environment, because your consciousness
          is extended by the environment.</li>
        <li>Objects that extend negative aspects of the mind need to be removed, such as social media.</li>
        <li>People can extend your consciousness just as objects, so be careful with people too.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Fix your environment
      <ul>
        <li>Clean, aesthetic, beautiful surroundings and objects create happiness. You may consider moving into a
          village if it's prettier. Become prettier yourself, for other people to treat you better.</li>
        <li>Nature, expose yourself to it. Urban environments are not good for mental health.</li>
        <li>Prioritize health</li>
        <li>Eat healthy</li>
        <li>People are essential to your happiness too, for example, community, love, romance, respect, and trust.
          Become such a person yourself first.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Fix your life
      <ul>
        <li>Understand: Insecurities show what you are missing. Worries about something you don't know, stress about
          something you should have done, and fear showing you where you are weak.</li>
        <li>Before you move on with your mind further, you need to master worldly stuff. Principles to cover: Thinking
          long term, Sacrificing, Living life to the fullest. Regret minimization. Competence. Discipline.
          Responsibility. Speed. High standards. Challenge. Growth. Enjoy the moment if you don't need to think
          long-term about it.</li>
        <li>= Get strong, as a strong life creates a strong mind and a strong mind doesn't have weak thoughts.</li>
        <li>Practical measures: gym, cold showers, no sugar, no idle time, focus, a goal to work towards.</li>
        <li>Follow your role.</li>
        <li>Change your identity to a better one</li>
        <li>Free time is a lie, a wandering mind creates unhappiness.</li>

    <li>
      Spirituality
      <ul>
        <li>Final (and infinite) stage of human experience. Your mind becomes redundant altogether, you move on past any

  <h1>Why you will be hesitant</h1>

  <p>Now it may sound as if I reached the final level and I have. It took approximately 3 years and I have no longer
    anything in common with almost anybody, unfortunately, most people will never get the necessity to fix their minds
    in the first place. Here is why. Does it take longer to move 3km or 1km? Easy, 3km, because you will take the car
    and move faster than on foot. Most people will never have obstacles as great to gain the incentive to change and
    discover much better alternatives.</p>

  <p>I have achieved the highest level known to me. Maybe I will find it silly to stop at spirituality with just 300
    words written about it, although all the dark blue texts in my blog discuss it. </p>

  <p>This guide isn't a step-by-step one, you can attack these fronts at once, only spirituality comes last. The steps
    rather symbolize how much abstraction is involved in it.</p>

  <p>But there is one thing, one significant one, which has been bothering me for a few months now and I couldn't
    resolve it. That's because I know that I'm in control and know too little (and contradictory) things at the same
    time, therefore it's hard to apply these tips, how do I take radical responsibility, if I know little things about
    it and they contradict themselves? How do you fix such a thing? Well, I will take a pen and piece of paper and write
    down everything I believe to be true and everything I believe to know; it will be well spent time if the result is
    an even more fixed mind. But I know exactly what's holding me back. When I write down everything, I will realize how
    silly I was¹. That's just like the traumas. If you write them down “I have no home, no father, no community, no
    safety but a strong mind” these thoughts enter the physical realm and become <em>insignificant</em>. In “<a href="blog_70.html">Desperate awakening</a>” (read the text “Desperate awakening”, it's one of the best texts I have ever written) I have also
    explained why you don't want your negatives of the mind to sound silly because they would reveal your mistakes, make
    you look stupid and remove some drama, interesting parts of your life. The interesting and motivational narrator
    would be missing. But, if you finally take that piece of paper and make yourself look stupid and irrelevant,
    something will feel missing afterward, some negativity to make your life more intense. But you can plug these holes
    with the help of a strong goal, it will give you more focus.</p>

  <p>As soon as I arrive from my vacation in Turkey to Germany, I will turn on the lamp, take out a piece of paper, take
    a pencil, sharpen and journal. May this be the thing I remember this vacation for.
    <br> Simple things have an immense return on investment. Therefore, there is no secret to success. You simply have
    to do things with the highest return on investment over and over again, especially if they sound easy. Is it easy to
    clean your room? Yes.
  </p>

  <p>¹I have now (a few days after I wrote this) done what I described and I distilled the core question, which was
    actually bothering me, and discarded the rest. I realized that my concerns were valid, but I hadn't figured out what
    to do about it entirely.</p>

  <p>Alternative path</p>

  <p>My path didn't work like that. I mixed up the orders completely, I started with fixing my life, then my mind, and
    then I became spiritual at the same time I started to fix my environment, meaning I started to clean my room. I
    don't recommend doing that, because it's easier to clean your room than to remove traumas, initially. Of course, if
    you start from the top, it will become easier to do the lower-level things such as cleaning your room. Without
    knowing it, all of my older texts propagate this approach. At first, I cared about nothing, built competence, and
    then used the gained momentum to fix my mind in parallel and become more competent as a result. Then I gained free
    time and started with spirituality and with <em>making my hair</em> and <em>cleaning my room</em>. Now I know why
    that worked. I
    had a clear goal, this goal led me forward. You may not know your own goal, or your goal may not be all-encompassing
    your entire existence, because desperation is lacking. If that's the case, use this approach to fix your environment
    and life to figure out your goal. If you already have an authentic goal, follow the order recommended by other
    texts, especially the texts “<a href="blog_64.html">The final battle</a>”, “<a href="blog_73.html">Competence</a>”,
    “<a href="blog_6.html">The only way to live</a>” and “<a href="blog_50.html">Failures kill</a>”</p>

  <p>I used past pain to generate a huge desire, this broke like a spear through the mind's negatives. I attacked my own
    dark thoughts by showing that I was capable. </p>


  <h1>Great depression</h1>

  <p>Now, you may be wondering why some people suffer more than others. Why for example Dostoyevsky felt like killing
    himself although he had achieved everything: success, health, love, community, family, expressing gratitude, being
    (to some extent) spiritual, and having perspective. </p>

  <p>That's because some people sense changes, and anomalies and suffer in advance to adapt to them before they happen,
    most commonly this happens with authors, poets, or artists. Commonly this is called a “sensitive soul” They suffer
    in advance and for more people. Dostoyevsky already sensed that things aren't going to go mentally great for the
    common person, a double-digit percentage of people feel 150 years later like committing suicide, showing depressed
    symptoms, or just not being happy, because they must accept the whole caused by consumerism in the soul. To make it
    short: Dostoyevsky was a century ahead, and like many other great people too, he suffered in advance.</p>

  <p>But just because they sensed the future, doesn't mean that you have the right to do it too. Please don't get me
    wrong. Neither of us is one of these great people a century ahead. What's more likely, you being a name remembered
    forever or simply having little control over your mind? If you have a bottle of Coke on your desk, you know which
    one it is for sure. I know that hard times are about to come in the next 100 years and I'm not depressed. I'm
    excited, you should be too!</p>

  <p>Furthermore, here is another reason why you can't defend nihilistic thoughts and philosophize about suicide by
    claiming that great people did it. Most great people don't have negative thoughts either. Do you think Kant felt
    like killing himself?</p>

  <p>I'm 16 btw, and I'm surrounded by mostly young people around the age of 17-19 people and therefore I found it
    useful to add this negativity section and why it's nonsense. I find it sad that 60% of young people think about
    suicide, depression, global warming, and overpopulation all day long. I don't know if that's a symptom of a
    corrupted mind or rather part of the problem. But, to clarify, suicide is bad, murder doesn't solve overpopulation,
    and depression isn't something every great person has. I find it weird that young people don't know it and spread
    things like “having children is wrong” Perhaps you have not made much progress since you were 12 years old, 6 years
    ago.</p>

  <p>Maybe you still think that it's good to be a great but depressed person. Do you want to experience mental suffering
    your entire life? What do you then live for? No, just because you are depressed it doesn't mean life is useless, you
    just haven't figured it out yet. </p>

  <h1>Last wishes</h1>

  <p>A fixed makes you free, allows you to live the life you want, and all while being happy.</p>

  <p>I think now you have had enough complex input for the rest of the day, remember, look what you extend your
    consciousness with! Take a break and meditate for 15 minutes, and reread this text later and maybe also the texts it
    links to. </p>

  <p>I wish you the best. </p>

  <p>Appendixes, related but separated</p>

  <h1>How taking notes changed my life</h1>

  <p>I don't know if I have already written this text or a similar one, but this kind of content was typical for my
    texts which I wrote around March or April, when my journey gained momentum, so in comparison to my current texts,
    it's shallow, because it's obvious later, but helpful in the beginning. This is not the original version, but a
    modified one, to suit this text.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>How to take notes</li>

    <p>Taking notes on a phone is harmful to your mind and taking notes on your computer is suboptimal. That's because
      thoughts need to enter the physical realm to leave your mind; writing them on a computer tempts you to delete them
      later or not write them in the first place. Write on paper, because things stay there forever. If you stay
      something, there is no possibility of modifying it, just as on paper, therefore it's more natural. I exclusively
      use a pencil, although a pen may be more “official” This “official” feeling slows you down and makes you hesitant
      to write, therefore you sort your thoughts better. By contrast, writing using a pencil makes writing more intimate
      and restricts you less, therefore, it's better to analyze vague or particularly emotional thoughts with it. </p>

    <p>Writing on your phone should never happen, carry a notebook with you at all times. I used to write these texts on
      paper, but I no longer do that, because I want others to be able to read them, and writing on a computer is also
      significantly faster and can be edited later. (It would take around 20 hours to write such a text per hand,
      instead of 5 with a computer)</p>

    <li>What notebooks to have</li>

    <p>I have strictly spoken 5 notebooks. At first, my computer to write these texts, then my calendar (paper), random
      small paper notes to write down temporary things, a progress tracker/diary, and my personal notebook. I didn't gratitude journal on paper, I did it mentally, still, I would recommend doing it on paper, at least initially. </p>

    <p><strong>Progress tracker</strong></p>

    <p>My progress tracker started in April of 2023 and it had a massive impact on my life. It held me accountable, gave
      me more motivation to do little things and big ones, made “scary” tasks easier, created deadlines, and gave me
      huge amounts of confidence, because no one could doubt me anymore, as I wrote down everything that I was doing.
      (Section “Environment” of this text) Because I got much more confident, I portrayed that and no one doubted me
      anymore. Because it holds you accountable, it's easier to get rid of bad habits, and also, it's easier to do the
      little, boring, easy things it takes to succeed. For example, as I practiced speaking almost every day for 5
      minutes, I wrote it down, because it would be valuable in the future and feel good to write down before sleep.
    </p>

    <p>It's enough to write in bullet points. I write always the date, the day of the week, and the weather (either High
      (=sun), High/Low (=a bit cloudy), Low/High (=grey sky) or Low (=rain)) and I write the weather down because of an
      interesting story… After that, I write down what I have done towards the goals, interesting events on that day,
      things I have learned or deadlines as well as future ambitions. Next to it, I write how I would rate a day on a
      scale of 0-10, and I have given the number 10 already 3 times, in 6 months, all in August.</p>

    <p><strong>Gratitude Journal</strong></p>

    <p>This is explained in detail in the next appendix. Write down small, random things you are grateful for every day.
      “I'm grateful for the light switch which never failed” This will bring gratitude, a positive of the mind to
      replace the mind's negatives. If you do it regularly, grateful thoughts will pop into your mind at random and
      improve your well-being.</p>

    <p><strong>Personal notebook</strong></p>

    <p>Texts similar to this one have been written in my notebook before it got replaced with my computer. I also wrote
      down algorithms, plans, ideas, brainstorms, and similar creative ideas, things I have learned, and so on. I,
      unfortunately never wrote down traumas or things I know would be good to write down, because this notebook is
      “clean” it only contains content that could be read by other people. I know that this should be fixed.</p>

    <li>Default items</li>

    <p>Your notebooks should become your daily companions, and effectively replace your phone. What do you need for your
      phone, except to waste your time? As a torch, calling, email, communication, note taking, and registration or
      payments. But, all of these things can be and should be replaced with a standard torch, bank card, computer, and
      notebook, because the temptations of your phone are just too great and too harmful. By the way, a notebook will
      make you feel better and more stylish, and therefore you will feel better, a notebook is a good item to extend
      your consciousness with.</p>

    <li>Don't limit yourself</li>

    <p>The most important tip while taking notes is to never restrict yourself in the thinking process. If there is an
      “annoying thought that won't work out anyway” in your mind, write it down, no matter how silly it seems. At least
      it clears your mind from it. But chances are, you will find useful ideas by writing down that thought that was
      bothering you. Don't restrict your thinking.</p>
  </ol>

  <p><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

  <h1>How far you can go</h1>

  <p>Someone told me recently, that when they fly, they think of taking an axe to break the window and get sucked out.
    Holding a nail gun and losing an eye or going to bridge and their loud inner voice saying jump. Some hold their
    phone over an edge and get scared of losing it, others step on something and think that their family is going to
    die. The clouds below look like a soft pillow, may I jump down…</p>

  <p>I forgot that something like this even existed. I heard it's supposed to be normal. In that case, mediocrity is
    terrible. I hold my camera over an edge and think about nothing. I sit at the window of the shaking plane and enjoy
    the colors of the sunrise. </p>

  <p><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

  <h1>What I'm grateful for</h1>

  <p>Be grateful to fix the negatives of the mind… Here are practical tips.</p>

  <p>Take a notebook and write about things you are grateful for. You don't have to write them down, it's enough to do
    it verbally. I would recommend at the beginning to write them down, to get into the habit. Just as the habit of
    taking deep breaths (which you hopefully wrote down, as advised) reminds you of mindfulness (=presence, or how I
    call it, mental “online”) gratitude will help you to the same, bring you back into the current moment and removing
    useless negatives of the mind. Soon, you will start to get thoughts of gratitude at random, instead of negative
    ones. It will make you stronger because weak thoughts will be reduced. </p>

  <p>Gratitude in general reminds you that there are others in the world expect for you, therefore reducing the impact
    of your negative thoughts, by creating presence and positive thoughts, gratitude is positive itself. Gratitude is
    attractive as well if you need one more reason. People and companies that attribute their success to luck are
    perceived to be more honest and therefore more trustworthy and positive, no one wants to hear “Well, everyone is so
    stupid, and I'm smart”, rather “God gifted me with ideas, a strong mind and a hard life to achieve great things”</p>

  <p>You don't have to write/say/think “I am grateful to be born” because soon you will run out of things to be grateful
    for which are of the same significance. Be grateful for the light switch that never failed in your room, be grateful
    for your pen that's writing flawlessly, or for the thing you ate today. Talking about food and gratitude, I
    recommend replacing gratitude with God instead. </p>

  <p>If you are about to eat something, think of God, take deep breaths, and be grateful at the same time. God will help
    you to be grateful. Religion itself is of enormous use itself. I don't want to say it's “personal preference and it
    must be in order with your values” because you must be religious, combined with a fixed life and a strong mind, to
    experience better well-being. The religion you want and how intensely you want it, that's part of “personal
    preference” If you feel like being an atheist, saying Christianity is nonsense and evil and talking bad of Jesus,
    chances are, you are currently going to a bad phase of your life. You simply can't say “Believing in God is
    irrational”, because chances are you said this emotionally. In general, intelligence and rationality are offensive
    tools of the mind, and not defensive like emotions are. Intelligence solves puzzles but doesn't remove pain. After
    all, if you were that smart, why haven't you figured it out yet and keep denying it? I don't blame you, because
    society is getting insane because of consumerism and discouraging what's real and meaningful. I know that getting
    rid of your old beliefs is painful because it makes you look stupid to yourself and creates a temporary hole in your
    heart. At the ages of 13-14, I identified as an <a href="blog_65.html">atheist</a> as well.</p>

  <p>God will help you to handle uncertainty, regret, and fear as well. Those are things that spirituality can't even
    handle. Religion is central to the human experience and happiness. You will learn this later, if not now, and if you
    keep denying this, you will suffer mentally even more. If you worry about something you can simply say to yourself
    “God will handle it” and come back to the current moment, together with deep breaths, a straight back with your
    shoulders back, and gratitude. Praying is a good habit and effective against the negatives of the mind. Every
    so-called <a href="blog_65.html">atheist</a>” I know is unhappy and has more likely a broken life, <em>it's all connected</em>.</p>

  <p>Believing in God doesn't mean you need to go to church every week, it's enough to have trust in God and to be
    faithful. Some may not be religious but still believe in God: “I don't go to church and I don't know for sure if
    there is someone above me, but I think there is” You also don't need to learn long prayers right now; simple prayers
    and expressions of gratitude are enough at the beginning. </p>
