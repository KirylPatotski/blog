    <h1>A walk</h1>

    <p>My last walk was on the 23rd of September because after I got sick, went to Venice and right after Venice I went
        to Türkiye. In late September, my 17 to 19 walks encountered sunsets every time, and after not going for walks
        for 20 days (!) I went on a walk again yesterday, on the 6th of October, just a few hours after returning from
        Türkiye. </p>

    <p>It was already twilight; darkness was taking over and I was vulnerable. No phone, camera, friends, torch, or
        knife. Instead, I entered a part of my daily walk which was surrounded by forest, in which I saw wild animals,
        deer, roe deer and it made a sound in the scrub. I didn't care, a little bird wouldn't threaten me. But then, I
        was taking a turn and I saw a sudden white flash 30 meters away, at a wide angle, barely in my field of view.
        The flash was around 2 meters tall and half a meter wide. Consciousness struck me again; I woke up because I was
        scared. </p>

    <p>I looked again, but with intent, and saw, that it was a partly collapsed birch, hence white and tall. It was
        quiet. I thought to myself, this would be the last walk. I am not walking again, alone in the dark through the
        forest. I also saw someone during that walk…</p>

    <p>Then, I walked a bit more and thought to myself. What is supposed to happen to me? Just because I saw a collapsed
        birch am I going to quit walking? I realized it's all a test. It's irrational and in this case illusionary to be
        changed because of some imaginary illusion.</p>

    <p>Then, I walked further and thought about being tested by reality and reality in general.</p>

    <p>Yes, life is unfair. I could have been born mentally dull in some slum in Africa. Instead, I got a bunch of life
        experience, material wealth, health, and a sharp mind for effectively free. But the true realization came here:
        if every moment constitutes a test, doesn't that mean, that trying your best is the only solution to life's
        unfairness? </p>

    <p>If you have been given a lot of potential, it must be for a reason: you owe unlucky people your effort. You must
        use your situation to make the best out of it, for everyone. One could have been born with even more wealth, but
        if you wasted your time, instead of improving one at every moment, you would have not fulfilled their intent,
        not used their gifts, and harmed the collective by doing so. You must use your gifts because just relaxing on
        them is truly unfair, therefore you deserve nothing. However, if you try your best and make God proud, using
        your gifts, such as a sharp mind, for example, you deserve them.</p>

    <p>Every moment is a test. Whether it's an imaginary flash holding you back from going for walks or a mindless
        moment wasted on the internet, no moment should be wasted, everything happening is a test that you must pass.
