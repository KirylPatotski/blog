      <p>I will make a decision by 12:35 and implement a few hours later. That's what I thought of.</p>

      <h1><span style="color: #FFC400">Follow the will you didn't choose or pay a terrible price</span></h1>

      <h1>Fight for her heart?</h1>

      <p><em>Written from the perspective of a naïve 16-year-old, terrible in love, after getting rejected.</em></p>

      <p><em><strong>As if free will meant that.</strong></em> God exists. You may be tempted to think that you are in
        control of your thoughts, dreams, or desires but the presence thereof demonstrates precisely that some other
        power exists within yourself. You may name it how you desire. You can't make yourself interested in something or
        someone, it just comes naturally, no matter how hard you try, you can't change what you are passionate about and
        what brings you in the flow. All have such desires commanding the will and fighting against that will leads to a
        price too expensive to pay, a lost battle in the fight for a meaningful life. If you know that you are excellent
        at writing and it brings you in the flow, it's better to do just that, even though it may bring little income,
        compared to trying to suppress this desire. There is a whole series of mental disorders and most of them stem
        from you knowing that you aren't doing what you should be doing, i.e. your mind, body, intellect, and life are
        not in harmony. Because your sanity is at risk, don't fight against your will, or if you do, prepare yourself
        for months of depression! Good luck with moving on! You didn't choose this will but trying to think it away
        won't bring anything, you must follow it or pay the price. God decided that and you are powerless. </p>

      <p><em><strong>A matter of respect?</strong></em> If she rejected you and told you that you should never try
        again, is it disrespectful to not listen? No. You may think it's rude because it could create a lot of
        unnecessary pain. But that's only materializing if you are truly attractive, as it assumes that she will never
        find the right one for her and live a life of terrible regret where she looks back at the many chances she had.
        However, this scenario is not necessarily likely, what about the way of the middle? Not too long ago I admitted
        to another girl that I had a crush on her and she is no princess. I worried about the damage I may have
        inflicted - yet in reality it created none. Hence, thinking that asking her out may create some emotional
        turmoil is true, but no damage in particular. Unless of course, she has a will towards you and she isn't aware
        of it but refuses to accept and fights against it. In this case, fighting further is beneficial. Also, I don't
        think it's rude, as it creates some sweet memories to look back on, unless she never finds anyone better, which
        of course could happen. Though, if she thinks that this will happen, what is she waiting for? </p>

      <p><em><strong>No one loses.</strong></em> If you have your will, you can't do anything against it and realize
        that it's not disrespectful to fight, there is also some heroic aspect to it. You do, even if the probable
        outcome is a failure, all to avoid regret - by doing so you establish yourself as a person who does things, like
        a knight. Additionally, if she terribly regrets (or will in twenty years) rejecting you, as discussed, fighting
        further will create damage, but not for you. You may hurt her for a bit, but if you have a strong desire for
        her, you are the weak one, and subverting your depression is more valuable than being a pushover by listening to
        women. You should set yourself above the situation and try to think. If she doesn't care about you, and you
        don't fight you will become depressed. If she doesn't care about you and you fight, she may also feel valued and
        you can save yourself from gaining regret and depression. If she cares about you and you don't fight, it's
        better for you to never look in her direction, because you would get regret almost beyond comprehension. If she
        cares about you and you fight, your dreams come true. So, you can't lose. When you remove the possibility of
        failure you establish the certainty of success. </p>

      <p><em><strong>In retrospect.</strong></em> If you know a thousand people, I guarantee that at least twenty of
        them fought and succeeded. What would you do in retrospect? I know that it's easy to get fooled when it comes to
        women in the absence of experience, but what's interesting in my situation which isn't that unique either, is
        that I had a razor-sharp vision of what the perfect woman was like and my sister made me pay attention that
        there was someone just like that. So, what wait for if you desire her anyway? What waiting ten years, just to
        find someone precisely like her, who are you fooling? I can also tell from experience that relationships that
        start at a higher age tend to be worse. (1) Often people wait for someone better to come and that's why they
        keep hesitating. (2) When older, only the superior person will be able to change, i.e. negative traits and
        habits won't be able to be improved by the partner or by you in normal situations. Personalities are simply more
        flexible, it's easier to get used to each other. (3) The bond is also stronger when you get together younger as
        one will have fewer breakups, heartbreaks, and rejections as well as less sexual experience. Those things make
        relationships exponentially weaker, every time you break a bond, logically, the next one becomes weaker. (4)
        Every old wise man is going to tell you that a working relationship with your high school sweetheart is the best
        thing you can get and one of the best situations to be in your life in general. She won't care about the person
        you will become but rather demonstrates that she will take you without your success, i.e. the relationship will
        only get better as you become more desirable. (5) It's cute. - You can't fancy to miss such a chance. </p>

      <p><em><strong>The most important decision.</strong></em> The choice of the woman is the most important choice you
        will make, ever. If you think you found the right one, what do you hesitate for? </p>

      <p><em><strong>Of course, she won't love you.</strong></em> You have to pick a woman that chooses you but, if she
        doesn't know you and it's only you who loves her, who says that she will not develop an interest in her? She may
        think that she can't imagine a relationship with you, but let me translate: she feels like she can't imagine a
        relationship with you right now. There is nothing constant or rational about women. I have yet to meet a woman
        who isn't brutally short-sighted and overly emotional. Even those feminist kinds of women are likewise, they
        just try to suppress this, thus do what they aren't supposed to and suffer mentally as a result. (Don't fight
        your will or you will pay!). If she is not ready, - I mean if she feels not ready right now - for example, if
        she just went through a heartbreak based on unexpected betrayal, she may think to be not ready because still
        demonstrating depressive symptoms. But that's completely irrelevant. I don't mean to be disrespectful, but the
        new love is likely to be the solution to the problem. Also, because things often happen on their own, there is
        no point in thinking that one isn't ready. For example, I started to break free from my traumas in December 2022
        and on a random April night 4 months later it happened on its own. You or the woman will never feel ‘ready', yet
        one must learn that waiting never brings anything. If wait for university to start, just ask yourself why and
        what makes you think that you will stop waiting there except for desperation. Don't wait, do! There are
        countless examples of you thinking that you aren't ready, still doing it and then learning that one is never
        ready for anything, one has to grip life. Women are the same thing as life, that's the first lesson about
        romance, and every child knows it. If attacking life always works, why not grip life here as well and fight for
        her heart? Show her that you love her to remove any doubt. Though I advise you, be careful, because I think I
        scared off my love because I wasn't careful and pushed too hard. Things do take their time. </p>

      <p><em><strong>If you are the woman.</strong></em> If you truly don't want him, there is not much you can do
        except to reject him many times. Trying to shift your behavior doesn't work. Though, perhaps you are not so sure
        yourself. If you change your mind, it's better to admit being wrong then to insist on being right, but without
        love. Remember that he will be the only guy fighting for you for the rest of your life, because that's not
        too common. If that guy is then also beyond conventional, really assess what you will regret. </p>

      <p><em>Pray to God, ask the Lord to teach you how to love and how to forgive. But do not try to push anything
          yourself, do not resist. </em></p>

      <p><em><strong>Is she the right one?</strong></em> Find it out. If you both love each other without any extra
        effort, it's not guaranteed you are compatible either. Fight if you are young, because then at least you have
        the option to make her become the right one and to become perfect yourself. Beyond the age of ~22, it does not
        make sense to push anything, as it's already too late. When you fight, try not to resist anything and leave your
        mind open, as then nothing will be able to hurt you. If she is not, try to laugh about your silliness. </p>

      <p><em><strong>Regret.</strong></em> The most common regrets are working too hard, neglecting people close to one,
        refusing to accept that happiness is a choice, not living authentically, and not having the courage to express
        feelings. Decide which regret you want. I want none. Regret shows where you didn't do where you knew exactly
        what to do. Skip a life of non-unique lessons, and learn from others. The pain of rejection is short in
        comparison to the eternal pain of regret. If you lose, moving on will be free of regret. You won't regret
        fighting. What would you do if you were ten times as confident. Be a knight.<br><br>The choice is yours.</p>
