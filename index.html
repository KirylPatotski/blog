    <p>Tomorrow, I will push hard while running.</p>

      <h1>15.4.2024</h1>

      <p>For three days I've been silent and here is why. </p>

      <p>A few days ago, I wrote that I couldn't sleep out of pain if I saw the dream girl who rejected me at a party,
        which would have been on Saturday, April 13th. I would be in such pain because that would mean that I'm stupid,
        falling for a degenerate party girl who didn't even listen to warnings in my texts and the other component of
        pain would be that it slightly invalidates my existence, what keeps pushing for if she's attracted to a random
        loser? </p>

      <p>Worse even, a few days ago I noticed that my crush on her returned, and I don't know if it's not an illusion.
        It returned in the first place since I got the impression that she was trying to chase me and I could be super
        wrong here.</p>

      <p>I went silent on Friday evening. I wrote the physics exam, went to the gym, biked, went for a run, returned
        home, and then my life collapsed.  I spent until 23:00 just watching YouTube, which hasn't happened in months
        or years. All of the tension from the exam was released. That's the moment I went silent, I knew that if I saw
        this girl at the party the next day, I would have to break my promise, as I would collapse out of tiredness
        anyway as I ruined my sleeping schedule on Friday. So essentially, I went silent because I wanted to avoid
        responsibility. </p>

      <p>Another reason for my silence is that I wanted to take a break and let a bit of time pass, I wanted to avoid a
        scenario where I wrote 'to hell with her' and 'I love her so much' just a week later. I wanted to control my
        emotions again, which I did by not writing for a few days. </p>

      <p>Anyway, the party on Saturday went as follows. At 21:15 I met at a friend's house with two other friends, we
        stayed there until 22:30 and then we walked 5 minutes to the club. It was my first visit to a club and I met a
        few classmates, also two of the ones I left behind a grade below me. It was very relaxed. Music, happy people,
        dances. I looked around in the building and found the dance floor and it was empty, so being the supremely
        confident alpha male that I am I just started to dance as the first person. After thirty seconds zero people
        joined my dance and I went back to the others. Slowly, everyone got dancing and I danced the hardest despite
        being sober. (Some people think I'm on drugs constantly if they see me in real life because I have a seemingly
        endless drive, but I can assure you, drugs are for crackheads and why I'm full of energy is so complex that you
        could write a 276,400-word blog). So, on my first party, I was the first one on the dance floor, which means, I
        could party better first try than those with lots of experience. I guess, I can turn everything into a success
        story. Later on, I asked multiple people since I knew that I perhaps might not spot that girl, whether she went
        to this party and they all said no which I found relieving. I will leave out some details I wish to forget, but
        the party was, in the end, a real disappointment and I do believe that only losers, playboys, or hoes go there.
        I guess, my texts were right, at least it wasn't too crazy since mainly my classmates were there and we don't
        live in a big city. We stayed there until 2:00. In a club, the music is as loud as a smoke alarm, and that is
        for hours on end. The air contained some random aerosols, which wasn't pleasant either. The girls there, despite
        some of them being hot, were repelling, and to phrase it a bit less ambiguous, I was deeply disgusted by party
        girls. Then, I had the constant fear of someone smacking my head with a glass bottle from behind, and so on. And
        the worst thing about the parties is not that the music is too loud, but the sacrifice of time. You are at the
        party, for say five hours and then the next day is ruined because you are just mentally slow and exhausted. I
        think my time is at least ten times more valuable than that of a normal person since I'm fast and a day wasted
        is like a week wasted for a normal person. - Parties are too expensive. I can't afford them, just as I can't
        afford to go to the cinemas to assassinate my mind. The only acceptable scenario to go to a cinema is with a hot
        girl or so. Consequently, parties are for hoes and losers. Amen.</p>

      <p>In the end, though, I can be happy to not have seen that girl at this party, maybe she improved and got
        smarter. </p>

      <p>On Sunday and today, i.e. Monday, did well. Running and gym are daily, the crush stayed, as well as my paranoia
        of suddenly seeing her once every three days, discipline improved further, I'm reading a lot, my
        lack-of-calorie-too-much-motion-problem is fixed, and I'm working on video creation as usual. </p>

      <p>With love, Kiryl</p>
