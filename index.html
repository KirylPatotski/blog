  <p>Difficult decisions, spectacular sacrifices, and a life in motion. Strongly held beliefs and absoluteness in every
    word. I live every day as if it's my last. My name is Kiryl and since the age of 13, I've been building myself up,
    I want to become an entrepreneur. Now I'm 17, I experienced plentiful and learned even more.<br><br>

    In these blogs, I talk about different interesting stuff regarding my life, productivity, mindset, creativity, and
    how everything comes together. Have fun reading and getting inspired. The newest blogs are at the top. <br><br>Tip:

      <h1>31.5.2024</h1>

      <p>Example of a well thought out compliment, from yesterday. Now the kitchen is installed.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Me. </strong></em>“Why do you speak Russian so well”
        <br><em><strong>Guy who installed the kitchen so that my future girlfriend will be able to cook.</strong></em>
        “Why shouldn’t I speak Russian, I grew up in East Germ-“
        <br><em><strong>Me.</strong> “Well, but you look like post GDR, something like 35 and most East Germans don’t
          speak a single Russian word.”</em>
        <br><em><strong>Guy who installed the kitchen so that my future girlfriend will be able to cook.</strong> “I'm
          52, …“ </em>
      </p>

      <p>A year ago I concluded that I must be the sexiest person in my town. I'm as romantic as a knight, who else
        writes brilliant love letters? Today I managed to compliment a 52 year old to make him feel as if he is 35, I'm
        charming. I have a six pack and high levels of cardio training simultaneously. The contents of my diary are
        unmatched, I have many stories to tell and live every day as if it's my last one. I learn fast, you can tell me
        a thing once and I'll remember it for the rest of my life. Action, effort and sacrifice do not scare me. I'm
        ambitious, indefatigable and disciplined. Furthermore, I'm always as present as the heaven is above earth. My
        extraordinary mind makes me a pleasure to chat with. My curiosity is sophisticated enough to make people feel
        bullied by my questions. I mean what I say, so with me you don't have to worry about ambiguity in my speech and
        I'm authentic in my word, action and desire. Loyalty also defines me, without any comment. I never hesitate to
        express gratitude, love or share joy. This list could go on… Yet, these things haven't changed in a year, so
        what's new? I can drive, cook (stopped in 2021 though), have a perfect Abitur, and now I even spent my time
        learning how to renovate*.</p>

      <p>Certainly, everything comes a price. No one ever described me as nice. I have zero tolerance for many things. I
        judge frequently and harshly. I don't compromise and I have a tendency to put my time above everything else. I'm
        also a bit insecure - I don't know if 'insecure' is the right word – I take everything very seriously and cannot
        handle anything less than mastery. For example, I couldn’t handle being in a relationship with a girl who’s not
        a virgin. I have standards that exceed anything you've ever seen before. In certain situations, I’m arrogant.
        I'm not subtle, if your dress is ugly, the food you cook not tasty, or something bothers me, I will let you
        know. I’m very jealous and terretorial. I also enjoy bragging. I hate subtleness, devaluing your word and
        keeping your mouth shut until the problem becomes too great to handle just for the sake of politeness. </p>

      <p>What am I writing this for? Well, currently, I'm busy renovating and now I have a break. My mother,
        grandmother, and many of my low-status classmate mocked me for not knowing anything 'practical'. Even my former
        math teacher mocked me for skipping 9th grade while not knowing how to lay tiles. Thus, I need to write that I
        even improve on real life things so that I become definitely the sexiest person in my town. </p>

      <p>June starts tomorrow and it’s at the center of my most transformative time from March to September 2023. It’s
        hard to believe and to think back at how much changed.</p>

      <p>Though, I will tell you, I hate the summer. Do I enjoy mosquitoes in the night? No. Do I enjoy it only getting
        dark three hours past my bedtime? No. Do I enjoy sweating while just sitting? No. Summers are for betas. Amen.
        Everyone is outside having fun, eating ice cream and enjoying life, unlike on a foggy November night in the
        forest which I find a lot more interesting. Seeing other people have fun annoys me. In the summertime you can’t
        even cuddle because of all the heat. If you like flowers – did you know they bloom in the spring? People who
        like the summer are so weird they must be cat owners. </p>

      <h1>30.5.2024</h1>

      <p>At the bottom of the page, I have a new text. (Dresden is boring.) It's written for someone, and hence won't
        get published as a
        regular text. I have also linked it as a pdf if you want to print it.</p>

      <p><a href="#div_id">To the text</a></p>

      <h1>29.5.2024</h1>

      <p>Today I we got our graduation papers and I have a grade of 1.0 and had I had a single point less I would not
        have a perfect grade. I felt guilty, because some gave their best and failed regardless and I won without
        doing anything. Not only did I not do anything for school, I spent my time in school writing texts, meditation,
        editing photos or with programming in 11th grade. And remember, to those who have more will be given. - Hence, I
        felt even more guilt. I concluded that I simply must be one of God's favorites. Are you one of God's favorites?
        Maybe you are. <br>A bit later, it was time to go home and I remembered half-way home that I came by bike.
        That's the reason my mother mocks me, because that's far from the only instance of brutal incompetence
        in everyday life. I simply put my capacity somewhere different. Now you may be thinking that I was excited
        because I got the graduation papers. But do not forget, I'm Kiryl P. and I don't care. Even though I may not
        have known my grades, graduation papers are not a first dates, hence, there is no reason to get excited.
        Forgetting I went by bikek made me wish change. But unfortunately, that's not my priority so I will maybe
        perhaps likely do something in the future about it.<br>Since I'm on a trip the next days, I will have a lot
        more.
        time to write.
      </p>

      <p>Frist impression of the apartment in Dresden? My love does not live there, hence it is not home.</p>

      <p>The biggest problem with arguing using a blog is that I'm not present. The content of a message is almost
        irrelevant. It's about how you say it that matters much more. For example, read the text where I advise against
        going into medicine, especially if one wants a family. If you are reading it's something completely different
        then saying aloud 'I don't actually want to pursue family too much and blood brings me in a flow and I really
        like how that status feels like'. If you are a woman and want to become a doctor, consider that only useless
        men change dipers, I certainly won't. But arguments like that aren't very potent if they are just written
        down... Furthermore, because I'm not speaking with presence on my texts, I cannot react to
        thoughts people have directly to argue my point. Ever wondered why sales are made in video calls and not per
        emails? Because saying things out loud makes you accountable and so you cannot afford to speak nonsense. That's
        why you think about the subject much more then just as if you were sitting at home thinking 'do I like blood,
        yes or no'. Your thinking when sitting at home is different then the conversation you can have with a person ten
        times smarter. Put differently, do you think there's zero discrepancy between what I write, how I am and how
        others percieve me, even if I only write things I would stand to defend? To paraphrase text #33, "Say it infront
        of 1.000 people to determine whether its true."<br>Put even more differently, I don't argue in German and
        Russian. I
        cannot establish surperioirty in the languages I don't excel at. </p>

      <h1>28.5.2024</h1>

      <p><strong>14:00.</strong> Am I open minded? Well, in 2022 I watched my last movie because I concluded my life
        must be a movie and
        watching movies is a waste of time. Maybe I was wrong in 2022? Ten days ago, I gave into the pressure created by
        my grandmother and watched a moive and liked it. Anyway, we watched a few more movies and now I'm at my 2022
        belief. I was right, if my life is a movie, what do I need to waste my time on movies for? I'm not sure what the
        moral of this story is, maybe "be less open-minded", "listen to Kiryl P.", or "don't watch movies if you want to
        live an interesting life"? Most likely it's this: don't try to fix the things that aren't broken.</p>

      <p><strong>15:45.</strong> By the way, that girl is a lot more attractive then I had her in my memory.</p>

      <p><strong>23:19.</strong> Life is simple. The new microphone did not arrive because something didn't work with
        the bank. But then, I expressed to my mother how much I need a new microphone and she started figuring out
        solutions.<br>I always felt like a loser while biking. I would bike and come to a stop very quickly and had to
        push hard at all times while still being slow. Slowness contradicts my self-image, which makes me suffer. So, I
        asked my classmates why that is and how to fix it. Seat must go higher and the breaks have to be repaired
        because they are too tight.<br>Now the most important story with an extremely simple soulution. I looked at my
        channel two weeks ago and started to think: do my videos suck, yes or no? The answer was yes. It's not my
        personality that sucks and neither are the messagess I send, it's just the audio quality and the thumbnails are
        ugly. Instead of worring thinking dark stuff about myself, I used Occam's razor and found a simple solution, a
        new microphone.<br><br><strong>23:38</strong> Videos coming forward as well, I'm scripting genuinely powerful
        videos with PowerPoint
        presentation to elevate the quality even further. This voice stuff is going forward as well, I was surprised how
        many people noticed that my voice got a lot deeper, I stopped stuttering and mumbling, of course until the
        graduation prank-fun day progressed.</p>

  <h1>Why teacher is the perfect job for women</h1>

  <p><a href="pdf/Why teaching is the perfect job for women.pdf" download>PDF version for prining</a></p>

  <p>Firstly, why can I speak on that topic? My mother is a teacher. Also, I don’t know if you noticed it or not, but
    teaching is what I like to do and exactly what I'm doing right now. Hence, I know what I'm talking about. Here are
    the reasons why teaching is a great job for women.</p>

  <p><em><strong>(1) You control how much weight you add to it.</strong></em> Weight combines stress, time, emotions,
    and other things. Some teachers are not very active while others voluntarily take on many responsibilities. As a
    teacher, you can become as important as you want in your school or even across schools. It is also possible to go
    part-time and prioritize family. Work-life balance is important for mothers. The power to vary weight considers that
    priorities may shift over the decades to come, which is especially relevant for you as an aspiring mother of many
    beautiful children. </p>

  <p><em><strong>(2) Teachers aren’t stressed, many are relaxed.</strong></em> Some teachers report being stressed,
    though that’s a misconception. (a) Everything is stressful at the beginning. (b) Competent teachers are not
    stressed. Some with an F in math who became a teacher might find it stressful, but they would find everything
    stressful anyway. (c) Beyond a certain point drama at school with some students becomes irrelevant and you learn to
    handle it. You also learn to establish yourself, that’s why the classes of older teachers are always quiet. If you
    are already the leader of your female friends, have excellent grades, and are pretty, you will not have to worry
    about stress as a teacher.</p>

  <p><em><strong>(3) Emotional balance.</strong></em> For instance, the literature teacher of my sister matches this
    profile. If your husband is very assertive, you can express your power-hungry side at work. </p>

  <p><em><strong>(4) A lot of evidence.</strong></em> The majority of teachers are women. They seem to do well. </p>

  <p><em><strong>(5) Teachers are abundant in free time.</strong></em> Most people like to relax. Virtually all women
    like to relax. Most people want a life with a family, job, garden, and maybe sports. Maybe I'm sexist, but I think
    women should not strive to be hyper-competent and live every second productively while optimizing every single thing
    about their lives. I can create 10 videos in a day, solve 10.000 mental math tasks in 11 hours to demonstrate the
    superiority of your apps, or write 8.000 words in a few hours. On the flip side, on vacations I become depressed and
    this is no sarcasm, I can’t handle lying in the sun, eating in an all-inclusive hotel and there’s nothing I hate
    more than just sitting on a boat. That’s my life and that’s what works for me. Not to be arrogant, but do not
    forget, you are not me. I work because I want nothing but success in life while most work to get time to relax. Most
    men and practically every woman on earth couldn’t handle my lifestyle and would suffer pointless pain if they tried
    to endure it. What should a future mother get up at three in the morning for? Stress is only healthy for a very
    certain caliber of person, for everyone else, stress is crippling. If you truly wanted an extraordinary and
    ambitious life, you would be living it already. In that sense, free time is a nice thing for you and women in
    general, and you should be authentic with your desires. </p>

  <p><em><strong>(6) Teachers are hotter than doctors.</strong></em> Teachers are around children. The whole point of a
    teacher is to help children grow up. Do you see how that’s helpful? Your sexual market value increases, which means,
    you become more attractive as a teacher than as an ‘ambitious woman’ who wants to become a doctor or something
    similar. Many men, including myself, find high ambition in women repelling because it undermines fundamental
    principles. Long term, if the woman brings more cash, has higher status, and works longer hours than the man, the
    relationships tend to be unhappy. You might think that that’s irrelevant in the 21st century and that gender roles
    can be inversed, but that just does not work in almost every case. Now you may be thinking that you can just take a
    man of even higher status, ambition, and money than yourself to counter the problem of the woman being high status
    and the man a beta. That can be possible, but not very likely because where is the complementary opposite and why
    should a man with immense status pick a girl who won’t be able to focus on family? Being a doctor as a woman
    drastically reduces your chances of a happy relationship, it makes you less attractive and compatible with far fewer
    options next to being stressful and exhausting as a job. If you choose a job like a doctor which will make you less
    attractive, it better be worth it! ----- Everyone with common sense above the age of 35 understands that this
    feminist doctrine of ‘women need to prioritize work over family’ is false. Frankly, women who believe this feminist
    stuff aren’t desired among men to begin with. Maybe I'm a bit biased here again, but I would argue women should only
    work for fun, provided they are attractive. Teaching is a job you can work ‘for fun’. Doctor not, that’s your entire
    life. Why do I think women should work for fun only? There’s no reason an attractive woman should work a job she
    doesn’t like except out of desperation, i.e. if the man doesn’t bring enough cash. Working a job you enjoy,
    increases your emotional well-being and health. You also gain more fulfillment and purpose in your life.
    Consequently, you become sexier. Your man will feel better as well and work harder. Working for fun as a woman
    drives a positive feedback loop. ----- Being a teacher increases your attractiveness. You are around children -
    motherly - and that’s what men look for. You are not too ambitious and hence don’t repel high-quality men. Instead,
    you spend time with children and relax to your liking, which makes teachers desirable.</p>

  <p><em><strong>(7) I promise you’ll love it.</strong></em> I promise you will be grateful for never having to work
    night shifts, never having to worry about death or life decisions and you will certainly appreciate standing in
    front of the class and the attention you’ll get. Teacher is also a well-respected job and respect equals status. Job
    security is high and salaries are above average, at least in Germany. Schools are everywhere, schools are necessary.
    I assume you enjoy studying yourself. I’m convinced schools have a better atmosphere than a sterile hospital with a
    piercing smell and the omnipresence of pain, schools are for children after all. Teaching, explaining, and
    correcting can easily bring one into a flow. I’m convinced it’s satisfying and interesting to watch your students
    grow up and become decent – with your influence. Is it not heartwarming to make two young students secretly in love
    sit together ‘because the class is noisy’? Who knows, maybe some students you’ll teach will surpass everyone in
    their bloodline and establish your immortality as a great teacher.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Kiryl P., 30.5.2024</strong></em></p>

  <p><em>For German women.</em> What kind of teacher should you become, Grundschule (primary school), Oberschule (middle
    school) or Gymnasium (‘elite’ school)? The answer is simple. If you like young, loud, naïve children, choose primary
    school. If you don’t like children too much and don’t want to do anything intellectual, pick Oberschule. If you want
    to avoid drama, degenerate students, and stress, pick Gymnasium. Higher standards make life easier for all
    participants. The gymnasium is also great because it’s intellectually more challenging. Altogether - the Gymnasium.
