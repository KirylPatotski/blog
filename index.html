      <p>By the way, the times of me bragging about being 16 years old are over.</p>

      <h1>11.4.2024</h1>

      <p>Today gym and run as usual. 50 minutes for the run. I will not give up running, the girl I'm no longer friends
        with said that I can't waste my talent given that I trained for 5 days and ran 10 km in 40 minutes.</p>

      <p>Today I realized something that I didn't get from my perspective. I always do things, especially if they are
        scary and I do that so frequently you could almost write a blog with 130 entries and 280.000 words. However, if
        my regained desire for that girl turns out to be not an illusion, it is certain that 'she shall come to me
        and admit her mistake' would be quite scary, especially for a woman. Whether it be awkward, I'd deny, I don't
        believe in awkwardness, I say whatever I want to and that makes people think I'm funny. Maybe I should writing
        where I am at which times so that everything seems like a coincidence and in the case, I can start an
        conversation which I am more capable of then you might expect because I have at least stories to tell.<br>I said
        yesterday that I will just ignore my heart's desire, and I stay to that, I will not take action first, have done
        that enough already.</p>

      <p>Tomorrow, the physics exam will be meditation, which does not mean I will take it lightly.</p>

      <p>I'm glad to look back on the last two weeks and see that I indeed fully returned to strength, even if it was
        with a delay and very slow at first. I'm stable, competent, disciplined and willing to sacrifce again. I love
        y'all and I love my life.</p>

      <h1>10.4.2024</h1>

      <p>Something like two weeks ago I wrote that dream of problems to wake up in pain and that I don't dream of hot
        girls like everyone else would. Ever since I wrote that, I started to dream of said thing. However, I didn't
        stop dreaming of problems and today I woke up with a few painful realizations. </p>

      <p>- Firstly, I noticed that I got a crush on this girl back. I had lost all hope initially and started to push
        because of this despair (#129). Nonetheless, since April 4th, I got my crush back, because I saw a girl who
        looked just like her pretty exactly where I predicted it the previous day. On top of that, as I went to the gym
        on Monday, there was a girl who also looked a lot like her and frequently gazed in my direction. <br>The problem
        is, it doesn't serve me. I can't know for sure if it was her, whether intent existed, whether she wants me, or
        whether she meets my criteria. I don't know anything outside of that she used to not want me and that I'm bloody
        na√Øve. If it is indeed an illusion, I have a serious problem, as I should obsess over my goals. </p>

      <p>- Secondly, I have not kept it a secret that I go to the gym at 14:00, then take a break at home from 15:15 -
        15:30, then bike 30 minutes to the route of the race I've been training for, rest a few minutes, and run the
        route for approximately one hour and then bike home for 10 minutes. So, usually, I'm home by 17:30, and after
        eating, showering, meditation, and writing these updates it's already 19:00. That's 5 hours that I sacrifice for
        sports every day. The issue is, that the likelihood of my victory in this race is low. Even if I give my best
        and run 15 km/h, there are ~80 other people registered online for the same route, 11 of them in my age group.
        This intense exercise brought me back to strength and productivity, which is without question and also without
        question that my ideal life does include such things. However, I can't think as productively when doing sports
        so hard, since my muscles take all the calories, next to the time I need to sacrifice. If I skipped the running
        part and went to the gym only, I would save 3 hours a day and a lot of calories. Perhaps I need to sacrifice
        running or massively scale it down. Maybe I will make a decision today after I walk the route, but it looks like
        I already decided what to do. </p>

      <p>- Thirdly, my life contains too much nonsense right now. I don't have peak performance if the physics exam,
        running competition, crush, driving school, and so on all take away my thinking capacity. Luckily, physics
        becomes irrelevant on the 12th and driving school on the 17th. But still, I need to subtract a lot of things and
        make my life simpler. My life must only consist of my 2020 vision, and then in the afternoon gym, and perhaps a
        girl. I need to regain focus after regaining discipline via sports.</p>

      <p><strong>13:00.</strong> Been in school right now and decided to simply ignore the first point since my senses
        can't be trusted.</p>

      <h1>9.4.2024</h1>

      <p><strong>13:50.</strong> I need to become more compassionate maybe.</p>

      <p><strong>18:07.</strong> Before I become more compassionate, less judgmental, warmer and so on, I need to tell
        you something. Today I
        looked at the school's website and there was an article about a student who went to marketing lectures in
        parallel to going to school. That pisses me off. I did that last year as well and no one cared. I built a few
        apps, started to fix my life, started a channel, started with the gym and went to lectures of business formation
        and marketing - no one cares! No one cares what I do. I'm, it seems, invisible. True, everyone in my school
        knows my name, but that's irrelevant in this moment. I don't target this guy, because he is at least doing
        something with his life and can tell you that I'm proud of him. Maybe he would make a great friend. But why is
        it the case that I need to overcompensate so hard and others don't have to? I did a lot more in my life then
        going to marketing lectures and get no recognition! What bothers me even more is that he is also 16 and goes to
        the gym no less then I do. At least I'm not stupid and see this as source of motivation. The girl didn't want
        me? Good. I'm irrelevant? Good. There's competition? Good.
      </p>

      <p><strong>18:15.</strong> The run today was a lot harder then yesterday, as my muscles were sore after running,
        gym and biking from yesterday and gym and biking today. Yesterday I ran 45 minutes and because many people were
        watching I ran the route form 16:05 to 16:51, 46 minutes. That may sound as if I declined, but considering the
        soreness of my muscles and that I always go to the gym before and bike there, that's a very good time.</p>


      <p><strong>19:38.</strong> Tomorrow is rest day, and I will walk the route in reverse at the same time as usual
        for a reason I won't write down, and to check out how many opponents I have in addition to their speed.
        Furthermore, I must take some pictures for my blog.</p>
