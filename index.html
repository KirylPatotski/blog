  <p>In these blogs, I talk about different interesting stuff regarding my life, productivity, mindset, creativity, and
    how everything comes together. Have fun reading and getting inspired. These blogs are in reversed order, the newest
    are at the top. What the colors mean is at the bottom. <br><br>Tip: bookmark this page, so you won't

      <p>1.2.2024</p>
      <p>16:04</p>
      <p>One of her girlfriends told me, that she doesn't want me because of the simple reason that she does not know me
        in person. And that's a pity, because (1) I want her badly, (2) she doesn't want to meet.</p>


      <p>15:14</p>
      <p>And now I don't know how to feel and what to think... <br>The new personality, it does not seem to serve me,
        maybe I should go back to the person I used to be?<br><br> One thing I thought about is the aspect of
        categorically telling the truth. It's often said that the truth lies in the middle, i.e. between always being
        real or always lying, which would mean that it's alright to lie sometimes. But, I couldn't handle being lied to
        even once, I hate being lied to when I was younger constantly. "Lie" is here a phrase that must not be taken too
        far, even banal things such as "Well, that musem is only opened on Mondays" qualifies as a lie. But then I know
        that most people enjoy to hear lies, such as, "well, it's ok". This argumentation will be continued in a
        seperate text, but perhaps I should revert to what serves me and what can become a universal moral law. The
        truth does not lie in the middle, because the truth lies in the opposite end at which the lie is located. I will
        continue to tell the truth or keep my mouth shut. What kind of character development could I be talking about if
        I wrote "well, I learned that I should lie with anything or pretend as if I don't have opinion, plan, idea or
        desire."</p>

      <p>31.1.2024</p>

      <p>19:34</p>
      <p>When things start under the worst condition, it's the best proof for that things will work out - if something
        starts effortlessly, the wisdom to handle the catastrophy won't exist.</p>

      <p>17:28</p>
      <p>Time to express hope again.</p>

      <p>17:24</p>
      <p>Also, I wanted to announce a new text, though I have to warn you, that it has nothing to do with anything. It's
        a mix of text #70, #34, #87, #112, #99 and notably of text #61.</p>

      <p>12:54</p>
      <p>Now I'm in a position where I can't lose, my character developed for the better in any case.</p>

      <p>5:21</p>
      <p><em>As if free will meant that.</em> You see, there were good reasons for me to be the way I was, but I took
        responsilbity and changed, demonstrating will. There is only one thing I can't change, do you know which one it
        is?</p>

      <p>5:05</p>
      <p>Of course you won't love me if we never even talked to each other.</p>

      <p>4:42</p>
      <p>What I like about myself is that I can reinvent myself fast. I've grown as a person within hours and the
        changes stayed. In May I would have written that I achived my dream lifestyle, now I achived my dream
        personality, which is permanent. (That means, I would need to contradict that love letter in many points
        already) Now may I come to peace. Every day I pray for things to work out and this was
        integral. I still hope for her.</p>


      <p>30.1.2024</p>

      <p>19:48</p>
      <p>I don't know anything, the only thing I know is that I can only hope and pray, maybe she does change her mind.
        If not, at least God knows that I've learnt my lessons.</p>

      <p>19:43</p>
      <p>I'm definetly going to remember this day.</p>

      <p>18:15</p>
      <p>That bliss from the paralyzing morning it's fading. I don't know what changed about me, but everyone noticed
        that something was off today in school.</p>

      <p>I also wanted to write that I drove a car for the first time of my life. At least, this time, driving was
        almost a spiritual practice. I wanted to point out how magical it feels to drive faster then I can run when I
        try hard without getting any of the exhaustion.</p>

      <p>14:43</p>
      <p>Sometimes it's better to make many mistakes then to do none.</p>

      <p>14:38</p>
      <p>It makes sense to view this as test of God, the core message of Christianity is the love for God and for
        everyone else.</p>

      <p>14:17</p>
      <p>This bliss is still persistent and it awfully worries me because I know myself. I felt this type of bliss in
        early September, where I let go of my app, and after two pleasureable weeks of newly gained mental freedom I got
        more or less depressed until around January 12th, with peaks of depression in late September, a smaller one in
        late October and a hard one from December to January. It's always a little paralyzing shock, for instance,
        looking at the numbers and having to admit failure on the app I worked on for years, followed by bliss, and
        then a few months of hardship, from which it is nearly impossible to recover. - But I do want and interesting
        life, full of hardship and here I have it. <em>It's when every second is filled with pain, but the bigger
          picture is as wonderful as it can be, every stroke of the brush brings horror and the result is the prettiest
          image one can grasp - truly breathtaking - just as the last moment of stillness before you know that you are
          ready for something new and even better, and this new even better time is ahead.</em></p>

      <p>If my love should change her mind it's only due to the people I used to despise. I feel like an idiot about
        myself. To answer the question, if pure reason is able to derive knowledge from the world, this is a lesson I
        learned a posteriori. But better learn afterward than never. I can't do anything, and writing that I need to
        apologize may bring nothing. I must not resist the natural flow of things.</p>

      <p>12:52</p>
      <p>"She does not like me as a person" would be foolish to think, because how and what I write still differs in
        some sense from how I am. I've told some people that she does not want to have anything to do with me as a
        result of this love letter. "You know, I kept my writing style" and everyone responded with "That's the
        problem." Fine, in future I'm keeping my fingers from that. I regret doing so.
      </p>

      <p>8:56</p>
      <p>Now I feel a very strange bliss: she does not like me, me who I am as a person.</p>

      <p>6:52</p>
      <p>If it was right to be honest, the problem must lie within myself.</p>

      <p>6:48</p>
      <p> Now every 'red flag' seems to be irrelevant, I feel awful for only recognising it now, I love her more then
        that. I guess that was nessecary to put me on the right course. </p>

      <p>6:30</p>
      <p>Maybe I should have lied, obfuscated, manipulated and euphemized my entire personality. Maybe people don't want
        the truth as much as I hold it for a duty. I hope my blog and the love letter didn't ruin it.</p>

      <p>5:30</p>
      <p>To cite text #112</p>

      <p>Every idiot can justify himself, because after something happens
        reality molds into the obvious and self-explanatory. Often, things seem to become clear after they are completed
        and the events contradicting this remaining reality get ignored and eventually become entirely forgotten. If
        something fails, that's because one ignored the fragile cracks forming beneath the carpet and something succeeds
        if one made progress despite the cracks. Any idiot can admit to being wrong and it takes even less intelligence
        to be proud of a victory. Everyone can and will point to the cracks of someone, but everyone is blind to view
        his own. Everyone tries to defend themselves; everyone has a corrupted perspective. The word bias doesn't make
        sense, as everyone possesses one. Hence, it's no challenge to complain about the past, yet almost impossible to
        look into the future, since reality is built in a way, where ninety-five percent of it is a projection of the
        mind - you see and hear what you want to and discard the rest. There is 'evidence' for anything you want to be
        true. You only pay attention to what you find exciting and filter out the rest, often without noticing. You will
        think, that you know better because admitting being wrong puts you in an awkward position and sometimes the
        position of knowing better comes at the very end. </p>
