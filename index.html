  <p>In these blogs, I talk about different interesting stuff regarding my life, productivity, mindset, creativity, and
    how everything comes together. Have fun reading and getting inspired. These blogs are in reversed order, the newest
    are at the top. What the colors mean is at the bottom. <br><br>Tip: bookmark this page, so you won't

      <p>Update panel - 16.1.2024</p>The conversation you are avoiding can be one of the biggest things holding you back.

      <p>Wrote a new text. Won't publish it now, (1) it would be illogical, because it contains some nuances that would
        not make sense (2) it has nothing to do with what this update panel is about.</p>

      <p>Update panel - 15.1.2024</p>

      <p>I will write less relevant news later, key message: I feel like in May and it makes me happy. Resting for two
        days made the difference. What I also wanted to admit is that this girl undoubtedly wants me, so perhaps it
        means that she wants to demonstrate that my worries are free of substance. Today I had a chance to talk to her
        and I didn't because I didn't know what about and because I was too scared. (I don't understand how that can be,
        because no one views me as a little meerkat, and how my daily life in my notebook looks makes me contradict
        myself.) As long as I'm too scared, I must not complain that she talks to that loser. Although I know that I may
        never be single again, so I may as well enjoy the last days thereof. </p>

      <p>The 4 videos I recorded yesterday turned out to be useless, because the audio quality was below what was
        acceptable. I can be grateful that it's just 4:14 and I can also be grateful for deciding against a walk,
        despite it beeing pretty outside. </p>

      <p>Update panel - 14.1.2024</p>

      <p>Today I recorded 4 videos and spent the rest of the day resting.</p>

      <p><em>Written in the morning</em></p>
      <p>As you might have heard, the last two weeks have been very unproductive, because of some nonsense -
        applications for internships. It was generally a 2/10 week because I was unconscious. If you are unconscious,
        you procrastinate and time passes a lot faster, hence you don't create any new memories or create anything
        productive. In October I learned that I can just do nothing for a day or two and everything is going to be set
        straight again. That's what I did yesterday and I feel completely conscious again. I didn't know how valuable
        was to be conscious until it got removed. Now I get reminded of Kant's book “Critique of Pure Reason” because
        what I'm about to tell contradicts it: you can restore consciousness by (1) Doing nothing; resting, meditating,
        staring at the ceiling, (2) Rewiring your brain; reading, listening to classical music, praying, and (3) By
        being slapped in the face. I knew of things because they were logical, not because I tried them out, that's why
        it contradicts this book, which says that it's inefficient to just think of things to find out the truth. I did
        nothing yesterday, I read the day before, and being slapped in the face I was, both with what I wrote yesterday
        and also quite literally: on Friday the 12th of January my class and I went to Dresden to a ballet. On the way
        out, I ran just as usually would, but then I slipped on some curbstone covered in black ice (to express
        something rather ironic, I rested a bit on the paving stones, before I could walk again). So that means, I
        regained my consciousness and now I have a bit to do, I want to record a couple of videos and complete some
        school work. Let me tell you, I'm not only able to obsess about that girl, I can obsess even harder on my goals.
        I uploaded already 33 videos, which is 66%. If I include the scrapped ones, it's closer to 45, which is 90%!</p>

      <p>Update panel - 13.1.2024</p>

      <p>If what I learned about that girl yesterday should turn out to be correct, I can understand her a lot better.
        At least I know that my phrase “I just couldn't understand why I got rejected because I don't know who is more
        attractive than me” had a darker twist, she supposedly had a neglectful boyfriend and their relationship ended
        in
        parallel on his behalf. Maybe I've also been a bit too cruel in my judgments about that loser, who helped her to
        get over it. An apology is vital, although what is obvious remains true, I still have a deep trauma related to
        people like him. In the past, I've written down 3 things I would not take her, which are social media usage,
        loser friends and her not being a virgin (I would find it wrong to dedicate to a woman for the rest of my life
        if I wasn't even her first pick.) Now the first two have sort of turned irrelevant and the third one increased
        in relevancy. I do not know how much of it is true, because I got the information second-hand and not from her.
        So, no one should gain any excessive hope, especially not me who struggles to un-love that girl after many
        disappointments and a long time that went by. </p>
