  <p>I appreciate you, my reader. I thank everyone who ever helped me. I'm especially grateful for my mother. This blog
    is about beliefs, insights, and adventures on my rather unqiue journey.<br> I tell my stories - Yet, this blog is
    truly not about me.

        <h1>Wednesday, 26.6.2024</h1>

        <p>I like to think of myself as though. Really? A month ago, I released a text, ‘On studying medicine and the
          twist of fate’. I explained why I looked so little forward to university in that text. I’m too much of a bitch
          to say no to university because I’m not successful. Then, this supposedly changed a bit after I was told to
          study medical engineering instead of this computer science nonsense. This novelty excited me. Yet, after a
          month of insights, I realized that I lied to myself. The problem is, I have zero desire to spend my life as an
          engineer; I would rather be a teacher of geography and philosophy and make the same exact money. I have zero
          interest in memorizing random nonsense that will distract me from my business.<br><br>
          Maybe I forgot what a year-long heartbreak felt like, but this pain is at least an order of magnitude larger.
          I don’t know how to explain it, but I couldn’t live with my last name, meaning nothing. I couldn’t be content
          with having a job, going to the village’s football club, and taking pride in having a daughter, a house, and a
          car. I couldn’t do it. I’m not built to live a normal existence. I absolutely mean it. You may think that I
          write these motivational stories just for fun and to look cool. No, I get depressed when I don’t work on my
          goals.<br><br>
          I have four months left before university starts, but I don’t know whether they will be able to make a
          difference. Maybe I should expand my time horizon. True, but I will never see a better opportunity.
          My resilience knows no bounds, yet, I’m not tough enough to live a normal existence.<br><br>
          That’s why I started to suffer in June 2023, as I burned out, and then later in September 2023, after I had to
          accept my apps were failures. I feared that I wouldn’t be able to get rich or establish an income before
          October 2024. I had suffered a massive defeat and I still feel the consequences.<br><br>
          Now what?<br><br>
          I have laid out a plan.<br><br>I view this as nothing more but a mental exercise, a price for success. Pain
          and stress is what makes me alive.        </p>

    <h1>Attention! </h1>
    <p>Texts from August 2023 - June 2023 (250.000 words) are offline until I finish enhancing them. I want to shorten
      my texts and remove their partially elitist tone. Furthermore, I wish to incorporate more privacy and keep a
      spiritual boundary. Many texts will never go online again because no one needs to know how much I struggled with
      heartbreak, for example. I have come to realize that I diluted my message and overshared. The texts currently
      online have already been improved. Because I don't want to go insane from
      writing all day long, this project will take some time. Approximately one to three texts a day
      will go online. I believe my readers deserve uncompromising excellence. </p>

  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p> My life is a movie. I believe it’s one worth watching, an inspiring one.</p>

  <p>My name is Kiryl P. and currently, I'm 17 years old. I’m from Belarus. At the age of 5, we moved to Germany. My
    childhood gifted me with endless motivation and a truly indomitable spirit. That’s a fancy way to say it was
    painful, difficult, and uncertain. At 13 years old, things had finally taken a turn. I laid out a plan for my
    future.</p>

  <p>The plan? I would grip my life, and excel at everything in the pursuit of success. For me, success and business
    were closely linked. I started to learn how to program at 13 years old to create a software business. At 16 years
    old I had to realize my mental math apps wouldn’t work out. Hence, I started to focus on content creation – for
    example, this blog, all as a part of my 2020 vision. </p>

  <p>In the meantime, every other area of my life saw massive changes. Heartbreak, sacrifices, difficult decisions –
    I’ve had it all at the times I would least expect; while knowing that I have barely started to live. I’ve had
    times where I wanted to quit and refused to. I've had times where I knew something had to be done - fast.
    I've had times where I thought, 'Moment, just linger, you are so beautiful'. My life is a movie.</p>
