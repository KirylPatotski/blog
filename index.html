      <h1>15.3.2024</h1>

      <p>The wise person knows where he is wrong and fixes it. They even learn from the mistakes of others and look
        ahead to inhibit future ones. When others give advice they listen and assess whether it could be correct. This
        person learns the easy way. Then, some people locate their problems but are too incompetent to address them,
        they are aware of their wrongs and don't adjust. They only adjust after life makes it clear they should, they
        learn the hard way. A level below are people who suppress not only the solutions but also the awareness of their
        flaws, they learn in the hardest possible way. Their life has to thrash them, only then do they start to learn,
        and sometimes only when the sweet force of regret joins as well. Then, there is the kind of person who hides
        their faults, suppresses their awareness thereof, and gets caught by the destiny of their wrongdoing. Life gets
        hard because of the problems they summon and force them to learn, yet they don't and get into the same kind of
        situations over and over again. They don't even learn the hardest possible way. </p>

      <p>I wrote text #122 because I wanted to make a change in at least the life of one individual. I didn't want this
        girl to ruin herself, despite receiving her rejection, I hoped, at least, that she would turn smart and learn. I
        wrote this text because I wanted to warn about parties. Today that party takes place and she goes there with her
        degenerate friends. My fingers are heavy when I type these words, but my warning has been spoken. I know many
        other women who suppressed the awareness of their faults, refused to listen, and fell into the same traps
        multiple times over. It looks like she is going to join this line. I fear it may be hopeless for her. I know
        enough people who have lived a life, and I can only hope she learns before it's too late, but I fear she won't,
        ever. Dear heavens! What was I excepting? - For her to learn and she didn't. </p>

      <h1>14.3.2024</h1>

      <p>15:15. Today reality is kidding me. Saw something today which qualifies as an insult. Today is not an
        interesting day - I got home, and so far I have done nothing remarkable. That's how it must feel to be an
        average person. Still, I bet I will be able to turn it around.</p>

      <p>17:39. Was I able to turn my day around for it to become a motivational story? No. Here is what happened
        instead. Today as I went to school, I felt kind of down… I had been unfaithful to God in the morning and
        deserved to feel down, not only because I was unfaithful, but also because God gave me some obvious signs of
        hope the day before. After school things went mainly as normal and after some shopping for construction
        materials I came back and started to feel a lot worse. That was 15:15. I went to the gym for a short workout.
        Then, it was time for the run. I started to run and I couldn't help to ignore that every single step hurt. The
        pain got so bad after 5km that I had to slow down. I presented myself as the alpha male on my blog, but slowly
        and unexpectedly I started to cry! Every step was hurting and I felt as if I was about to collapse of weakness
        but this wasn't the reason why I almost broke down physically and emotionally. I realized why I started to feel
        so down. Firstly, I lost hope that this girl read my blog, but I could be wrong. I know that this is sort of
        manipulation tactic 'to make me seem more authentic without the pressure' but I know deep in my heart God knows
        I'm real. This assumption seems reasonable because of the text I wrote recently… It hurts, it's not quite a
        liberty. Then I continued running with every step hurting and tears in my eyes while thinking that I hated
        myself. I tried to keep going to grow mentally, but couldn't. Instead, I realized that my character development
        of stopping being judgmental and distrusting of losers seemed to have been completed. I know this changed,
        because today during the walk I visualized myself talking to one and talking about my life. I also had a hard
        time realizing that I'm going to see my friends for pretty much the last time tomorrow. The half marathon I
        planned
        on Saturday won't take place… I also will take a few rest days. I know that when I start to cry out of nothing
        that means that I release all of the pressure that comes from living at the pace I do. The first time in
        May/June, then in October, December, and February I felt the same until I interfered. I continued to walk in
        pain and tears. I thought to myself, is this the life I want?<em>“Every day, I pray for a few things. 'God.
          Please
          give me a good night's sleep. Please make the love affairs work out, please make my future look great, give me
          health, …, teach me to love and to forgive, please forgive the sins I regret, and thank you for
          everything”</em> This
        is what I wanted. And now I'm taught how to love and to forgive. Are the other sacrifices necessary to have been
        made? I love and forgive, now what? Waiting for interesting things to happen. That's how you turn a failure into
        a success. </p>

      <p>Text #123 is going to be a lot more meaningful than you might expect. When you read it, you will realize that
        today had to happen.</p>

      <h1>13.3.2024</h1>

      <p>Here is an example of how I live by the maxim of always putting in faith and trying to get the best out of any
        situation. A few days ago, I decided to go offline, and as a result, I missed the message from the group chat
        that the gym class was canceled. I went to the gym hall extra early today because at 6:10 I realized that I ran
        out of ideas for the text I was working on. There, some people informed me that my gym class doesn't take place.
        I responded to them that I didn't feel like walking 250 m to my house and that I must practice to be in
        situations where I don't fit in. Another reason is sort of obvious. In the end, it was fun and I did what I
        wrote about in text #122 (chapter 4, developing self-awareness, §2); I tried a new thing, volleyball. Whether I
        like it remains a question I'm leaving open. In the end, I didn't lose any time, because at home I wasn't able
        to write anyway. Instead, I learned new things, and so on. </p>

      <p>Yesterday evening I wanted to go to sleep and a question kept me awake. What is my story and who am I? The last
        time I did this was in April 2023 and this night freed me of all the nonsense that happened in the past and left
        traumas and I got sick. Today I simply woke up in peace, but the energy remained. </p>

      <p>The third thing I want to mention is a decision. When I go to the gym, I will do so right after school. Since
        school ends next week. I'm going to the gym at 15:00 and for the walk/run at 16:00. I know that at my current
        level of walking, I'm capable of running 20 km, the first half marathon I will run on Saturday after the gym.
        Considering where I was just one year ago, it seems incredible. </p>

      <p>Next decision. From the 18th of January, I will stop getting up at 3:30 until May 1st. Instead, I will wake up
        at 5 like an almost normal person. In the summer getting up super early is vital because you can't think
        straight when it's too hot. </p>

      <p>The newest text is going to take a bit longer, it's going to approach the 10,000 mark, and maybe it will cross
        it. I don't know where the text will end and I will have to talk to many people about it. This text may change
        your life but it will change mine forever. </p>
