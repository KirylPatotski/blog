    <p>There is an allegorical story about 2 apprentice potters. One potter tries to create the perfect pot while the
        other one doesn't care about quality and crafts as many pots as possible in a short period of time. After 7
        days, the potter who tried to create the perfect one created 5 pots of mid-quality and the other potter created
        40, with the last one being of flawless quality and a vastly more efficient system to accelerate the production
        of further pots. - It's very likely that you have heard this story and simply accepted it without truly
        realizing its meaning. </p>

    <p>Let's say I would have tried to create the perfect essays at the very beginning of my journey in March or even
        February 2023. My essays severely lacked in-depth, the right tone, structure, choice of words, and many other
        quality aspects, but I didn't care and wrote them anyway. I wrote a lot - and now I am able to write 1000 words
        per hour in excellent quality. The text “Desires” which had a length of over 1000 words was the fastest written
        text ever - I wrote it in approximately 50 minutes. An inexperienced writer would take around 4 hours to write
        such a text, and even then, the quality is not guaranteed to be as high, because the skills are simply missing.
        I have observed that the vast majority of people struggle with perfection because they think that everything has
        to be of extraordinary quality and they need to deliver flawless performance. That's simply not the case at the
        beginning. If you fail, you learn, therefore, if you try to avoid lessons by focusing on quality, you will
        sacrifice lessons. These lessons are necessary to increase the quality in the long run. If you create a bunch of
        low-quality content, if you cook poorly, if you program poorly, write poorly… and do it fast, and fail fast, you
        will outpace any competition which is trying to learn the same thing. Experience comes from bad decisions, so do
        as many bad decisions as possible, and do them as fast as possible.</p>

    <p>Now, there is something more hidden about this approach. How do you think anything works in any field? A
        scientist will never go into the laboratory and simply discover something new - the scientist will try as often
        as needed and asses his results and adjust accordingly until something new is discovered. But a scientist is an
        absolute expert in his field, and even then, the scientist is not able to think through everything “hard enough”
        to get everything right on the first try. Even if you possess a large quantity of knowledge, you are still
        forced to act, assess, and then adjust. There is nothing you can do about it, that's just how life works, you
        simply can't predict anything with certainty, and this keeps life interesting. </p>

    <p>Everyone, including me and you have to start somewhere and hardly anyone has the amount of expertise as a
        scientist. In this case, there is simply no way around “Act, Asses, Adjust”, because any thinking process is
        useless without the proper data - how can you predict or estimate something you have no idea of? Consequently,
        you simply have to do, then get the data, feedback, or other information and improve, you need to adjust so to
        speak. When I started to create YouTube, I didn't care about anything except for starting, the videos were
        trash. Every time I looked at my videos of poor quality and adjusted. I improved my speech, animations, cut,
        light, the ideas, the script… One thing at a time, and now my videos have reached a significantly better
        quality.</p>

    <p>Act, Asses, and Adjust have massive benefits for your mental well-being. If you publish a video of low quality,
        you will no longer try to make it better, you won't be looking at your computer screen and wondering what else
        you could improve or why your videos have not reached a professional level. It removes a lot of negative
        thoughts because it removes any expectations. Also, it makes you much more adaptable, because of how universal
        and absolute this framework is. Act, Asses, Adjust provides you with instant feedback as well, which means, that
        you won't go off course too far, because reality will help you, and not bring any negative surprises – and
        avoiding negative surprises is very good for your mental health too.</p>

    <p>I asked ChatGPT, what other benefits this framework delivers, and it said: Resilience. But failures can be so
        fatal that they set back months' worth of progress. I have 5 days left to fix a failure that set me back by 6
        months because now I have gained the mental strength to do so… </p>
