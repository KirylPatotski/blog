    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">How to demostrate ruthless commitment and dedication - solve 10 000 math
            tasks</span></h1>

    <h1>Above and beyond</h1>

    <p>This story starts in April of 2023. At this point, I had the ambition to become an entrepreneur for 2.5 years and
        worked relentlessly toward this goal. I started to learn how to code at the end of 2020 when I was 13 and
        started to create YouTube in mid-2021. In August of 2022, I finally released my first app, a mental math app and
        in March 2023 I gave YouTube a new try, with my current channel. I gained so much knowledge in that time, and in
        April 2023 everything started to accelerate since I got always more knowledgeable and my mental capacity
        increased significantly. </p>

    <p>In April of 2023, I started to document every day of my life. April was the first perfect month, that I ever had.
        April was completely without distractions or bad habits. Also, since I started to document every day of my life,
        I had the incentive to give my absolute best every day. What do focus, knowledge, and motivation lead to, if
        they exist at the same time? April was shaped by more than just focus and high performance. In April I started
        to work on my current YouTube channel, I read a lot and I programmed a lot. Finally, I considered my app to be
        “done”, as it had every feature I deemed to be of value. I looked at all the other apps that I stand in
        competition with and noticed that none of them were truly great. They didn't care about design, motivation, fun,
        or user feedback. I thought to myself…</p>

    <p>How do I demonstrate ruthless commitment and dedication, me going above and beyond?</p>

    <p>If my apps are the very best, and still invisible, because no one knows me, they are useless. Because positioning
        yourself in the market is just as important as the right product itself. My brand is represented by me, so how
        would I prove anything to anyone? In April I came up with 2 ideas. </p>

    <p>I would complete 10 000 mental math tasks, to prove that my apps are easy to use, encouraging/motivating,
        interesting, and excellent for their goal, which is the improvement of mental math. Since my apps are just a
        part of the whole, this challenge should demonstrate, that I am committed, dedicated, capable, serious,
        creative, and responsible (I don't make excuses), that I am not scared of challenges, and that I go above and
        beyond for my users, viewers, and customers. I strongly believe that people are more likely to use products
        created by such a person, rather than the opposite, an unserious, boring, lazy, and irresponsible loser, and I
        think that you can agree with me on this. But I would need to prove it first, and that's where the 2 ideas came
        in. The first idea was the 10 000-math task challenge and the second one was an already failed project. </p>

    <p>Solving 10 000 mental math tasks sounds like a big task. It is big, and I didn't find anyone who has ever done it
        before and documented it. I wrote 3 pages in my notebook, in order to prepare myself. 10 000 math tasks, 1 task
        takes 4 seconds, as I noticed by looking at my previous performance in the statistics menu of my app. That's 40
        000 seconds. 40 000 seconds are 666 minutes, this is 11 hours. Instead of getting overwhelmed by 10 000 math
        tasks, I simply looked at the data and decided, that the task is very much within my reach. But that also means,
        that 100 tasks are just 1%. But at that time, I already knew, that going a bit further amplifies results, under
        the motto: “winner takes all” - who is the second fastest man in the world?</p>

    <p>In April 2023 I did not possess to mental capacity, or mindset so to speak, to achieve something like this.
        Everything comes at the right time - I waited and grew mentally. In May I set myself the deadline to do it in
        the summer holidays, as this made the most sense. In the first week of my summer holidays, my <a href="blog_19.html">burnout</a> was still
        present and, in the 2nd week, and 3rd week, I have been to Spain, the 4th week has been used for other tasks,
        such as YouTube or writing and the 6th week is already full. Now is the 5th week, and maybe the last chance in
        my life.
    </p>

    <p>On the 9th of August 2023, I prepared mentally for the last time and had genuine fear, but no sense of
        overwhelmingness. I got up at 6:30 (not at 5), the next day, August 10th, and made some preparations, for
        example, I installed a second instance of my own app because I didn't want to have a statistic menu, where one
        day makes all the other days invisible in the app which I'm using. Even though I considered myself to be a
        skilled programmer, installing a second instance took 1 hour, that's because my project is fairly big. Then, at
        8:20 I got started. The first 100 math tasks were by far the hardest and after the first 500 I already had to
        take a break, and they took half an hour. I rested again, as I completed the first 1000. The next 1000 were
        already a lot easier and so I only took breaks once every 1000 tasks. I had to change the battery in my camera
        multiple times. I recorded my phone with my other phone and everything else, including the computer displaying
        the time, with my real camera. I calculated that recording everything would take up to 170 GB, so I recorded
        only in timelapse mode, that's why it only took 10GB. After I completed 4000 tasks, I ate lunch. After the
        4000th task, I got into a real state of flow, where I did not think about anything and my fingers magically
        typed or selected the correct answer. That means the last 6000 tasks felt less exhausting than the first 2000. I
        certainly did not expect this to happen. But this went so far, that I could complete the last 2000 tasks, 2
        hours of math without a break. During these 11 hours in total, I felt - nothing. I had no thoughts, it felt like
        I was totally asleep. I am only me coming close to my goal. I sat the whole day upright, even though I was
        forced to look down, and therefore nothing hurt after it. I recorded the last few rounds with shaking hands, as
        I was very excited because motivation increases towards the end. It was good that I had no thoughts in that
        time, because otherwise, what would these thoughts have been? These thoughts would have reminded me that I am
        nowhere close to my goal, wouldn't they? That's what I mean by everything comes at the right time, because I did
        have enough mental growth behind me in April. </p>

    <p>I finished after 11 hours and 10 minutes. Things take as long as you want them to take. So, the real story starts
        now, with me going above and beyond… </p>

    <p>Appendix: Thinking long term</p>

    <p>Even if everything fails, and the YouTube channel, and the apps, there are a few things that wouldn't go away
        from this challenge, and that is my image. If people discover this text/video in 10 years, it will still have
        the same effect, especially if it's old by that point. My personal growth also stays as well as the new
        experiences I have made. From now on, no serious person can doubt my dedication, because I have proven it.
        Thinking long term and then executing what you have thought, is the root of success. </p>
