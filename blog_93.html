    <h1>Values ahead</h1>

    <p>Often, everyone around me forgets that my whole reality is 180° opposed to everything around me, hence my
        progress was quick. This text serves as an analysis of beliefs instilled in me that are “wrong” according to my
        grandmother or mother, meaning I justify myself here in protest. It's a reminder that I'm 16 and not 61.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Doubt projected onto me.</em></strong>
        Frequently, people close to me, who think to know my situation, propagate harmful things. Going to parties is
        against what every millionaire YouTube says and eating sweets once per month is something that killed my
        discipline and led to suffering recently. Quitting my programming course would have stopped my progress in 2021.
        I don't need to hear any nonsense stemming from your insecurities, <em>just because you think you can't do it
            doesn't mean I haven't done it.</em> At no time did listening to self-limiting beliefs serve me. I don't
        want to go any spiritual stuff in this text, because I'm going to say something about it later. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Radical transformations </em></strong>
        would have been impossible without drastic measures, for example, regular monk mode or that programming course.
        I knew that those things were right, even before ever hearing them on YouTube because it's common sense. Nothing
        extraordinary derives from the ordinary, stop projecting the ordinary way of life and thought onto me. I don't
        care about your insecurities and doubts, because I'm confident. So far everything worked out and didn't kill me
        when it didn't. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Thinking for myself with categoric stubbornness </em></strong> was the thing that served me for years
        and somehow, I got into the female belief, that stubbornness is harmful. Imperatives and maxims served me well
        and will do in the future as well. I don't know how often I say this phrase in person and how often I only think
        about it: “What's the moral benefit of it? If it's morally indifferent, why are you doing it?”</p>

    <p>“Well, the world doesn't work on imperatives” is the counter some people use. I can tell you; that you can live
        accruing to imperatives and maxims. There has never been a situation where I was forced to lie, I don't know why
        people think lying is helpful. I'm going to remember a lie forever. Now, why you don't like that outfit or
        painting? You don't have to lie; you can simply be careful in your expression. Lying isn't morally correct,
        don't do it. When a compliment is lied to, genuine ones lose their value. “I'm going to bring you back to 9th
        grade,” is a lie and a self-limiting belief at once. Lying is a bad habit and it starts with “If you don't clean
        your room, the Christmas man won't bring any materialism into the house.” Don't get used to lying. Because my
        mother kept telling self-limiting lies, my relationship with her was damaged irreparably. Now, whether I want it
        or not, everything she tells me is taken with a grain of salt. I simply can't know if something is right and
        well thought through or some self-limiting lie. It takes 20 years to build a reputation and 5 minutes to ruin
        it. Never lie, even if you think it's helpful. In reality, it's short-sighted to lie and inauthentic. If you
        read the book “How to Win Friends and Influence People” the second principle goes “Give honest and sincere
        appreciation,” it doesn't say “Lie your way to people's hearts” </p>

    <p>If there is moral good nor moral harm, why are you doing it? Is dying your hair or mowing the lawn morally
        valuable? No, it's indifferent, so why are you wasting your time? Work instead, that's morally aligned. “You
        can't act morally at all times.” No, you can, if you are free enough. Simultaneously, freedom is a result of
        every decision you have taken so far. That means, to have a moral life, you have to work years for it, and
        working towards it already gives freedom since it's morally correct. </p>

    <p>If it's morally correct, you must do it at all times. Going for walks is morally correct, and so I went every
        day, especially if the weather didn't look great. Acting this way sets yourself free and magnifies results.
        That's because it allows us to do things radically misaligned from everyone else. I'm living proof of the maxim
        “The extraordinary doesn't hide in the ordinary, doing things like everyone else leads to ordinary results.”
        There are many things no one else does or thinks, I'm opposed to everything my peers think, and my life has
        nothing in common with theirs except that we go to the same school. Of course, if our lives were similar, we
        would think similarly. Yet, a changed trajectory starts with changed beliefs and changed thoughts. If the
        weather is bad, go for walks anyway. Yesterday, the 7th of November, the weather was sunny and I thought to
        myself: the average person would go for a walk today. I refuse average behavior and average thought; I want to
        prevent the massive amount of pain and regret that come from being average.</p>

    <p>Monk mode, that programming course, or getting up at 3:30 are helpful and I will not let anyone tell me
        otherwise. When I listened, I suffered. Thinking for myself has served me well, what I described here is called
        character development. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Family, spirituality, and the way of the middle are all nonsense.</em></strong> I shouldn't forget
        that I'm 16 and the order of things isn't supposed to be messed up. Of course, those things are important, but I
        shouldn't lose track, because those things are irrelevant for me in my current situation. Do you know what isn't
        nonsense in my situation? Working super hard and acting according to imperatives. What kind of middle is there
        supposed to be, when my path is a fully different one? The way of the middle is nonsense, what do I need to slow
        down when young already? </p>

    <p><strong><em>What I wrote this text for. </em></strong>Often my texts predict the future, like “The Final Battle”
        predicting massive changes in September, October, and November and after a delay of 2 weeks, these changes
        started. These predictions are often too far, some will need years to come true, and they will, but it made it
        easy to forget where I am right now. Hence, it will be fun to reread this in a few years. This is a good reason
        but not the occasion this text was created: I wrote it because, for a long time, there has been a central goal
        pinned in the middle of my room together with some smaller ones I had to remember at all times. Just like you
        would read your abstract the night before an exam it utilizes your subconscious. Since I'm now in a light monk
        mode phase, where I cut everything out, to regain perspective after my first app died in early September, I need
        new goals to follow to pin to my wall. Setting goals was something I almost forgot the power of, hence I needed
        to regain the methods that proved powerful in the first place. </p>

    <p>Hence, the wise student remembers where one is coming from and where one is heading while keeping in mind the
        position and already overcome obstacles.</p>
