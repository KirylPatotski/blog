    <h1>The perfect week</h1>

    <p>In February some cracks started to appear, in August I made some attempts, and then in September, my first app
        died, which I spent a lot of time on. After this event, my life started to feel more different than ever before,
        the changes were mentally bigger after this than when I got rid of all my bad habits, or at least that's what I
        thought. My burnout was already 3 months ago at that time and didn't seem to matter anymore. I thought I figured
        everything out already and started to look forward. Little did I know, that the death of my first idea would
        bring suffering with it in a delay of 1 month.</p>

    <p>In mid-September, some liminality appeared, and I got a bit sick, therefore my daily routine got worse; it no
        longer included the gym and sometimes not even walks. This liminality strengthened itself, as I went on the
        final 12th grade class trip to Venice. My weakened body and mind became susceptible to instant gratification.
        “You need to relax too”, “It's ok to eat sweets”, and “If you continue like this, you will suffer terrible
        burnout in the future” were the phrases everyone propagated to me constantly, especially people whom I trusted
        and knew me. At the time I had already forgotten instant gratification and bad habits, and I saw the death of my
        first idea as a bigger change than April, where I got rid of all bad habits simultaneously. I was about to be
        proven extremely wrong.</p>

    <p>I started to eat cake as a dessert, for instance, every time and I occasionally got validated for it. I
        originally stopped eating sugar back when I was 11 and occasionally ate some sweets until the age of 14. As I
        approached 15, I felt confident enough to refuse sweets even if offered some. That's not disrespectful, by the
        way, it's only strange if people know you for staying disciplined at all times, seeing you being weak. I also
        took my first sip of alcohol in a restaurant in Venice and received validation from everyone. I didn't even know
        how validation felt previously, as I was not particularly known for the ordinary way. Other bad habits started
        to come in combination. Because, if you are already eating sugar, why not do the other bad habit as well? I was
        tested and failed because my weakened position made me susceptible. After all, why do what you are supposed to
        if you may burn out by doing so and can still do it later, you live only once. Why not eat sugar as well, dark
        chocolate is supposedly healthy. </p>

    <p>I knew very well, that discipline creates happiness and not instant gratification. That's what I fought hard for.
        Now I had an excuse for instant gratification. Discipline comes from a vision, which I lacked because my first
        idea died. As a result, I sank in desperate pleasure and was reminded again, what I was doing everything for.
        Never again do I want to be undisciplined. To add something: during my burnout, I reached a stronger discipline
        than ever before, and now that it was lacking, I started to suffer even more. </p>

    <p>Discipline takes time, it's the opposite of instant bad habits and instant gratification. I started to eat sugar
        and noticed, that after I was done eating it for 15 seconds, there wasn't much of a change. So why not eat sugar
        again? The negative consequences are spread throughout the day, that's why you don't see them. It's easy to do
        and almost too easy not to. Because the negatives are small and delayed, it doesn't feel bad to do bad habits.
    </p>

    <p>Then in Turkey, where I had been just 15 hours after I came back from Venice, I continued. I ate sugar after
        every meal. Yet, in Turkey, I was happy because the negatives hadn't been compounded yet, and my existence was
        also liminal, therefore negativity only struck me as I returned. I felt similar to June, where I would do simply
        nothing, except with some more negative additions such as bad habits, exhaustion, no goal, and depressing
        darkness, post-Indian summer. There were some sparks of hope, especially at the beginning. Although the
        beginning was still liminal, only now have I come back to the ordinary. </p>

    <p>I already sensed that the week from 9th to 15th October wouldn't be great. I didn't do what I was supposed to
        because I coped with what had been indoctrinated in me: “Rest”, “Low performance and bad habits are necessary”
        and “Don't overwork” I decided that I had enough of this inauthentic nonsense. I shouldn't have listened to
        people in regard to work, because looking at the past to indicate the future and the present, I have been
        correct with my way of living. Bad habits and instant gratification aren't just part of my authentic self. But
        simply being idle constitutes the problem, as that's not the way it's supposed to be. I wasn't doing what my
        inner self thought me to do and this created suffering, which was hidden by excuses provided by others. It's
        easy to claim that it's necessary to have low-performing periods. However, not that's not the case that these
        times must be dominated by instant gratification. Because it would become harder to resume again and instant
        gratification traps. Also, low-performing times don't need to be shaped by mental suffering either. If you plan
        to record 1 video on that day for instance, and go for walks for the rest of the day, that's acceptable. But
        suffering through instant gratification and therefore being unproductive, is not the way it's supposed to be.
    </p>

    <p>On my walk on Sunday, the 8th of October, I decided to change something. I should use an event to get rid of all
        my bad habits again and do what I was supposed to. I would live the perfect week, the second and last week of my
        autumn holidays. I got started as I got home, by creating a little plan and by recording a little video on my
        plan to regain discipline. But, I think, the entries from the diary should talk for themselves. Read them at the
        end of the text.</p>

    <p>To summarize it: I was strong only sometimes, but weakness dominated most of the time. I was unable to take back
        control. After productive chunks unproductive chunks followed in greater quantity. It takes half an hour to
        record a video and I was wasting too much time or simply doing nothing. I always said to myself, the perfect
        week shall start now. I wasted a lot of time. I wasted it. I wrote in my diary that I wasted it partially with
        my family. It was wasted, it wasn't lovely family time, instead mindless chores and conflict. Through the lack
        of discipline, I started to behave like a girl. This isn't a good combination with my categoric, stubborn,
        aggressive minimalist temperament which can be counteracted by self-control in disciplined times, but conflicts
        aren't known to be harmonic. I fought with my mother about some useless nonsense: she showed me kitchen utensils
        for the time I'm going to move away in 2024 and I fought with her, trying to explain that I don't need spoons, I
        use forks for everything (= categoric, stubborn, aggressive minimalist temperament) I felt even more broken on
        this Thursday, which is today, as I didn't accomplish anything today and laid in bed doubting myself. I thought
        that I might be unable to have healthy relationships if I fought over such nonsense. Something that never
        crossed my mind for more than 10 seconds in my disciplined times, because I was arrogant: how is someone chasing
        instant gratification able to? I thought further. A lack of discipline doesn't show the true self. Instead, it
        shows a corrupted self. It bluntly feels more “real” than the disciplined version, because it's the default
        state, the path of least resistance. The sun never shined that day in the first place, the sky was grey. </p>

    <p>I have fallen low. If the lowest amount I could read in a week was just 31 pages…</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, this week is almost over. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday remain. It's now too late. I have messed
        up. I have some school stuff to do, so my projects will go to a halt. The perfect week was a failure. I wasn't
        able to restore my discipline. But it reminded me, that I should never forget why I'm on self-improvement in the
        first place. Never again will I allow myself to be undisciplined again. Discipline is freedom. It allows you to
        get rid of expectations and trains you and prepares for the hard times. It frees you from the traps of instant
        gratification and strengthens instead. I won't listen to people trying to tell me otherwise. I suffer from a
        loss of discipline. Validation and advice mislead. </p>

    <p>Liminality is the enemy of discipline. You can only overcome this with the help of more discipline. Otherwise,
        liminality will take over. Liminality is chaos and discipline order.</p>

    <p>Maybe this text will make you feel better… There is one thing however that needs to be said. It's my fault. I was
        undisciplined and made excuses. I failed at every test the world gave me, I deserved to suffer. God was
        disappointed in me and everyone I'm going to tell that my holidays were thrown out of the window. I think I will
        fix my discipline after the liminality of the holidays ends and the liminality of no vision to occupy myself
        with. I will stay true to myself and listen to what is right, especially if it conflicts with my world. The
        ordinary way is incompatible with me, I shall not take advice propagating the ordinary because the ordinary
        remains terrible in comparison to discipline. </p>

    <p>Today I had enough pain to change course, I have had enough. It's time to be disciplined again. The perfect week
        shall start now! </p>

    <p>Never again do I want to be undisciplined. Now it's too late and the time is wasted. I will use the gained pain
        to accelerate.</p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

    <p>Do you know why discipline feels great in the first place? </p>

    <p>Let's look at the negatives of excessive discipline: burnout, rigidity, lack of spontaneity, social stuff getting
        neglected, and reduced creativity. But those can be fixed. What are the negatives of excessive instant
        gratification? Death and a shallow existence. What's better? Discipline creates freedom from the traps of
        instant gratification, it gives you the freedom to accomplish what you want and to live how you want, it tells
        you what you are supposed to do and gives you the strength to do so. It is in line with your nature, while
        instant gratification didn't exist 50,000 years ago, everything had to be earned and everything was in harmony.
        Earning a reward, such as berries constitutes a reward, but rewards without prior effort disturb that harmony
        and since that's not the way it's supposed to be, it creates mental suffering.</p>

    <p>Guess what the biggest regret for most people is. Wasting their most valuable time chasing the wrong things or
        nothing at all, because of the traps of instant gratification. Instant gratification is bad even in moderation,
        at least balance isn't a skill I have mastered yet. If you indulge in bad habits, the amount of pleasure in your
        mind prior is bigger than the activity itself! Materialism is a bad habit as well.</p>

    <p>The choice is yours.</p>
