    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">14 days of insights</span></h1>

    <h1>Traveling educates</h1>

    <p>Yesterday I wanted to go to bed at 8 pm because I saw the necessity of waking up at 5 am. Instead, I went to bed
        at 11 pm. Obviously, this essay is not about me getting up at 5, but rather the reason for me going to bed
        off-schedule.</p>

    <p>On the way home, from the flight Barcelona-Prague, I asked my family member what they have learned, because a
        popular German saying goes like this: “Reisen bildet”, meaning “traveling expands horizons” All of them said
        nothing, perhaps because they were, so to speak, mentally offline, trapped in noise or maybe they simply learned
        nothing because they were mentally offline all the time and trapped in the pleasure of vacations. Yesterday I
        reflected in my diary, what I have learned, that kept me from sleeping. I wrote down 12 insights, but I can't
        share every one of them, for obvious reasons.</p>

    <p>I'm grateful for this vacation. It did not yield any results any direct results, but I still have met new people
        and improved my social skills made a lot of mental progress, and learned a lot through reading. In the end, the
        attention is the greatest, and the lessons matter the most. I am blinded by the noise of my everyday life, I
        don't know what truly mattered, only my memories will filter out any noise. But still, there are some things
        that are true in this very instant, which have crystalized themselves already just after 2 days. </p>

    <p>1. Things take as long as you want them to take. I talked in front of the camera like an idiot every day (or at
        least the next day), in order to improve my speech. I have been going to the speech therapist for a while. The
        speech therapist could improve my speech significantly, but talking in front of the camera is still a completely
        different thing, because if you talk to the camera everything has to be perfect on the first try, this is hard
        to accomplish because it pressures you. That's a huge problem because since March I started to create YouTube
        videos, where I talk about my own life, just like this blog. I invested 52 minutes talking in front of the
        camera, those were the best 50 invested minutes in my life.</p>

    <p>2. You can only learn the hardest way or if you're smart the hard way. I certainly wasn't stupid, I knew that you
        could practice talking in front of the camera, in order to improve, but I still didn't do it. Only as I was
        tired of removing stutters from my videos, I had enough and decided to take action. </p>

    <p>3. Some people just don't like others. I went for multiple 10km+ walks in Spain, including one that reached a
        village in the mountains. I was hard to reach, only connected by 2 roads and on top of a ~400m mountain. The
        nearest other village was 1 hour by foot away. The houses and streets were unwelcoming, almost hostile. There
        was a 50kg dog in EVERY house barking at you, constant warning signs of surveillance, and alarms and signs that
        tried to prohibit you from looking in the gardens. While it may be reasonable to assume, that those were rich
        people, no, they had all old Volkswagens for 3000€ and the houses were in bad condition. I don't want to imagine
        what kind of people are living in such unwelcoming conditions. In Germany, many houses or gardens have a sign
        “Welcome” and not “Stay out or you'll get killed by my dog” like in Spain. I do acknowledge my limited
        perspective, but that's enough. I think I should add, that I didn't see a single person there. </p>

    <p>4. I never liked water, the beach, or the sea. But I did enjoy my last swim in the sea because I knew it would be
        the last one. Do things as if you are doing them for the last time.</p>

    <p>5. On my trip to Austria, which I talked about in one of my very first blogs, we only ate breakfast in the hotel,
        that's it. I took a plastic bottle with me, but didn't replace the water, so it stood for a while in the bottle.
        At that point, I already knew, that I shouldn't drink that water, and so I didn't. In Austria, I was basically
        without food or water, except for breakfast and some fish bread rolls. Noticing the positive effects of this
        fasting, I maintained the same thing for Barcelona, (but I did take water). So, completely hungry and exhausted
        we drove back from Barcelona 1 hour to our hotel via train, the train was crowded and we had to stand. The train
        tracks were parallel to the beach and the world was in golden light. There it hit me: vacations with all their
        relaxation, idleness and abundance force you into a meaningless and purposeless existence. But also, not
        everything can have meaning, so there is no reason to dislike vacations. So, I thought about why I hated
        vacations in the first place: I came to the realization, that I didn't dislike vacations themselves, but rather
        being trapped and unfree without autonomy to do what I desired. </p>

    <p>6. This one is not too new. Since the fall of 2022, I have aggressively tried to stand up and sit upright because
        every adult is complaining about back pain, even if they are only as young as 30 years old. I have even created
        a feature in my app, which reminds people to sit upright, using the sensors of their phone! Recently, in July, I
        read Jordan Peterson's book, 12 Rules for Life, (and learned that my grandmother is always right) and the first
        chapter of this book explains in 30 pages, why one should, sit and stand upright. It explained, that one's first
        impression is largely based on your body language, and if you look down, people will think that you are a loser
        and treat you like one because you treat yourself as one, and everything gets into a downward spiral. Naturally,
        I started to more attention to people, and I have noticed that ~97% of people don't follow this principle. I was
        standing and sitting upright all the time, I got so much more attention than in all the previous years! Some
        people, including women, when they saw me from the peripherical sight, even turned to say “Hola”, the Spanish
        word for “Hello”! Don't be a loser, or at least sit upright!</p>

        <p>Appendix: Another lesson revealing itself in the absence of noise</p>

        <p> 
            Almost a month has passed, today is the 25th of August. During this vacation, I resisted any bad habits even though it was a vacation, I never ate any sugar for example. This is a very powerful lesson, invisible at first, because it means, that I am able to stand true to my values even if there are massive temptations everywhere. Because everything applies to anything, it should be clear that not cheating on yourself in tempting circumstances will result in you not cheating on others in any circumstances.
