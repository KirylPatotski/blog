    <h1>Nihilism is fundamentally flawed</h1>

    <p>You can read about the history and what Nihilism actually is on the web, I won't explain it further. Note,
        Nihilism itself can't be attacked, because it is a way to see the world, but its views can be attacked and
        potentially deemed useless. You also can't attack Nihilistic philosophers for “propagating” Nihilism, because
        you must never constrain thoughts. </p>

    <p>Western philosophy, in my opinion, used to be excellent. Take Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, or Kant for example.
        Each one has contributed to their respective field and the content of their work laid the foundation for
        science, human rights, equality, thinking, and democracy, for example. They answered or tried to answer,
        questions on how to live properly. But Nihilism is different, because it throws everything into the trash can,
        by doubting the meaning of each one of these changes. Nihilism is the belief in Nothing and is therefore against
        religion. Nihilism dares to say, that life is meaningless. </p>

    <p>Well, there are several massive flaws with this way of thinking. </p>

    <p>First of all, if life is meaningless, what do we need philosophy and Nihilism for? It's illogical to do something
        meaningless, so why does Nihilism exist then? Let me give you another example. If a virus kills its host, the
        virus is purely destructive. Since the virus is purely destructive and kills its host, the virus strips away its
        own foundation and dies itself. Nihilism is a virus so to speak, because it removes its own foundation by
        stating that everything is meaningless. Therefore, Nihilism itself is meaningless, therefore Nihilism removes
        itself.</p>

    <p>The second thing I have noticed is that Nihilism is used by a lot of young people as their way of life. Luckily,
        no person doubts that this way of life does not result in maximal happiness. But then they get trapped, because
        why improve, if everything is meaningless? </p>

    <p>“In a million years you are going to be long forgotten and nothing will matter” is outright wrong in 2 nuances.
        First of all, in a million years the world will be a completely different one, without your existence, because
        every small change at the beginning creates large differences in the output. The other sense in which this
        statement does not show coherency represents the proper reply to such nonsense: “Well, everyone can pick a time
        frame where you'll be forgotten”. Nihilism is inherently against human nature because it strips away the drive
        for improvement and the beauty of existence itself. If nothing matters, then what about society, crimes, and
        morals? Why be nice and try to live the best life you can, if other people and you don't matter?</p>

    <p>Philosophy is actually the same thing as <a href="blog_48.html">math</a>, and like any science has the
        task, to make life easier (not necessarily better) For example, email has made communication easier and faster
        as well as cheaper. If philosophy does not make the life of the individual better, by uplifting, but
        instead strips the foundation of meaning, why do we need such philosophy for?</p>

    <p>Nihilists feel as if they are enlightened. If they see a person happy with their life, they assume (if they are
        immature) that this person lives in some kind of blissful ignorant bubble, which would burst, if they found out
        about Nihilism. No. You can still be happy, even if you know what Nihilism is. Happiness comes from fulfillment,
        which is the result of meaning. If you know that Nihilism questions meaning, and you accept this fact and
        remain/become happy, congratulations, you are complete. But those “enlightened” young Nihilists are not useful
        to society if they have these thoughts, also these thoughts come attached with many more detrimental downsides.
        If you feel that nothing matters, that you don't matter, it is a symptom of poor mental health, which is a
        symptom of being a loser, especially if you know this and still refuse to take action.</p>


    <p>There is actually a way to get rid of or to make peace with Nihilistic thoughts. Accept. Stand upright. Take your
        life in order. Meditate.
        There are bad things and things no one cares about. I guess, it's easy to complain…
