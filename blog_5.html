    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Full Procrastination Guide</span></h1> 

    <h1>Roots of procrastination</h1>
    <p>"How much do you think this stone weighs?" a wise man once said. His students gave random estimates, some more
        correct than others. "Well, that does not really matter," he continued, "the only thing that matters is how long
        you have to hold it."</p>
    <p>As I started going to the gym in February, I got a top weight of 240kg, so ~530 pounds at the leg press. Holding
        that for 16 reps was no problem, even though it was at the time a challenge (and is still unbeaten by myself,
        totally motivating). But now take a water bottle, you can try this out while reading, and stretch your arm and
        try to hold it for as long as possible. After holding it for 40 seconds you are going to think that you will
        never reach a minute, after holding it for 2 minutes your arm will absolutely hurt.</p>
    <h1>That means - stress does not matter itself, but the duration makes it much more
                potent.</h1>
    <p>Now, what even is procrastination? Well, it's the opposite of thinking long-term and for the future. I don't
        judge you for procrastinating, but I am trying to help you and therefore I need to explain everything.
        Procrastination is also the opposite of working to your limit and it is also the opposite of living beyond your
        comfort zone. Procrastination feels like a stone on your back, it's pulling you down and preventing you from
        accelerating and taking off like a plane, instead, it forces you to stay bound to the cage of unproductivity.
        The longer it lasts, the worse it gets, just as in the example with the water bottle. </p>
    <h1>1. Procrastination gets more potent the longer you hold onto
                it.</h1>
    <p>Human nature, without exception, looks to maximize pleasure, even if that included sacrificing for the long term
        and avoiding pain. Most living organisms are more willing to sacrifice in order to avoid pain than to gain
        pleasure because avoided pain leads to pleasure and too much pleasure leads to pain and - procrastination. Let's
        say, (I hope that's not too hypothetical) you got a girl/boyfriend with 1 000 000 000 €. Now you can finally
        afford anything you ever desired, except a nuclear power plant or computer chip factory, (but no one desires
        these things anyway). Absolutely everything you ever did would lose value. Worked hard for a car - worthless.
        Worked hard for a house - worthless. Worked hard to pay off loans - worthless. With so much pleasure you will
        feel like procrastinating because that is the very same feeling and cause.
    </p>
    <h1>2. Procrastination is caused by too much pleasure</h1>
    <p>You may not be as rich as a billionaire, but if your family makes more than ~ 500€/month you can become a victim
        in that sense. In the modern world, most people experience too much pleasure, especially because of the internet
        and modern easy life, with transport, on-demand food, and heating. Think about it, the modern world has enough
        of everything and more pleasure, especially, cheap and meaningless pleasures like warm water, sweets, or social
        media, no wonder you can't but be procrastinating. No one knows what pain even means. Let's say, you grew up
        with a hard life, for example, in Siberia. Do you think you would be procrastinating? Or is the American kid
        more likely to procrastinate, that had an extremely easy life with absolutely no pain?</p>
  
        <h1>3. The modern world is full of temptations that lead to
                procrastination.</h1>

    <p>I may sound very aggressive in this essay, but let me tell you, after you have read all the causes of
        procrastination, the explanation of what to do will be significantly easier to comprehend. Another thing that
        causes procrastination can be called mindset. Fear. Insecurity. Excuses. Self-limiting believes.
        Here I will keep it short.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="color: blue;">Stop self-limiting beliefs:</span> Challenge and overcome the beliefs that hold
            you back from reaching your full
            potential.</li>
        <li><span style="color: blue;">Be fast:</span> Rather than delaying tasks, take action right away
            to build momentum and avoid
            procrastination.</li>
        <li><span style="color: blue;">Gym and sports:</span> Incorporating regular exercise into your
            routine can improve focus, productivity, and overall well-being. </li>
        <li><span style="color: blue;">Take ownership and be accountable:</span> Assume responsibility for your actions
            and their consequences. Being
            accountable motivates you to avoid procrastination.</li>
        <li><span style="color: blue;">Stop excuses:</span> Avoid rationalizing procrastination and instead focus
            on finding solutions to overcome
            obstacles.</li>
        <li><span style="color: blue;">Be resilient:</span> Cultivate resilience and the ability to bounce back from
            setbacks. Resilience helps combat
            procrastination.</li>
        <li><span style="color: blue;">Embrace the opportunity to work hard:</span> Develop a positive attitude towards
            hard work and see it as an
            opportunity for growth and accomplishment.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h1>4. Mindset is the foundation.</h1>

    <p>Now that we almost reached the climax of this essay. Now you understand that procrastination is caused by too
        much pleasure, which leads to a weakened mindset, which gets even worse if you consider all the distractions. <a
            href=blog_3.html>Read about distractions here</a>. Now you also understand that procrastination gets more
        exhausting with every minute you experience it.</p>
    <h2>Why procrastination is a drug</h2>

    <p>Let's draw a chart, Happiness(time) chart. Let's also accept that only the difference matters and not the
        absolute value of happiness itself. A task itself may be hard by itself. For example, some complicated homework.
        If you do something hard, you need motivation to do it. If you completed the hard task, you feel relief, because
        pain reduces. However, if you procrastinate, the pain grows, and therefore the relief is even bigger!</p>

    <p>Read this paragraph a couple of times, to understand it fully. If you think you didn't understand it, here I will
        rephrase it.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Hard task = Pain</li>
        <li>Pain relief = Pleasure</li>
        <li>Procrastination = Pain, that gets worse over time</li>
        <li>If procrastination gets bigger, so will the pain and so does the relief</li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ Procrastination creates artificial spikes of motivation, and is therefore like a drug!</p>

    <h2>Break free</h2>

    <p>The last time I procrastinated was today, without a date. With my work ethic removing procrastination completely
        is impossible. This tutorial will show what steps you need to take in order to improve your situation and to
        make procrastination rare.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Procrastination gets worse with time, set yourself the maxim to do tasks that take less than 10 minutes
            right away. I started doing that on 1.1.2023 and it did wonders!
            <ul>
                <li>Clean your room every day</li>
                <li>Clean your desk</li>
                <li>Clean your computer/phone files and apps…</li>
                <li>Make your bed every day</li>
            </ul>
            Eventually, you will start these things as automatically as brushing your teeth. It takes only a few weeks
            to get used to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Procrastination is caused by too much comfort. Remove comfort. This short-term is the hardest step.
            <ul>
                <li>COLD showers for at least 20 seconds after every “normal” shower</li>
                <li>Gym</li>
                <li>No sugar</li>
                <li>No TV</li>
                <li>No internet</li>
                <li>No coffee</li>
                <li>For maximum results: no music at all</li>
            </ul>
            You already know what's holding you back.
        </li>
        <li>
            The modern world is full of distractions, you know your distractions. Cut them out for 1 week completely,
            then continue using them and slowly cut them out. If you cut out e.g. social media, replace it with
            something similar like reading, or if that gets too boring with podcasts. If that gets too boring, do some
            sports.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mindset, fix it
            <br>
            If you don't distract yourself, you automatically grow, because you build momentum. Read books about it, or
            wait till I publish something myself ;-)
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Summary</h2>


    <ol>
        <p>Causes</p>
        <li>Easy life means no pressure, no pain, too much comfort</li>
        <li>Modern distractions are holding you back from productivity</li>
        <li>A bad belief system caused by distractions and an easy life</li>
        <li>Procrastination gets worse with time, therefore you feel more pleasure by becoming productive</li>
        <br>
        <p>Break free</p>
        <li>Remove comfort</li>
        <li>Remove distractions</li>
        <li>Fix mindset</li>
    </ol>



    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

    <p>Do you know what's beautiful about “procrastination is a drug”? The sum of happiness and sadness, pleasure and
        pain is always 0. Procrastination simply amplifies these things and therefore acts as a drug. That means, that
        if you become constantly productive, your happiness will much more long-lived.</p>
