    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">The only way to live</span></h1>

    <h1>Purpose</h1>

    <p>I feel broken. I know, that thinking highly of myself and staying disciplined helps. I have a massively inflated
        ego and think to deserve more than everyone else, which doesn't mean, that I have to tell anyone, this
        self-perception allows me to accomplish something and to stay disciplined. It's a self-fulfilling hypothesis, in
        essence. I have often challenged myself and worked as hard as could for months on end. I did what I was supposed
        to do, and followed my purpose. </p>

    <p>The last 30 days have been shaped by strong mental suffering, interrupted by short spikes of hope. Now my
        trajectory is shattered and my inner conflicts large. This is going to be an important and detailed text that
        I'm going to write over the span of the next few days… It's about a purpose being accomplished and the inability
        to find a new one.</p>

    <h1>1. December 2020 - June 2023</h1>

    <p>In late 2020 my trajectory was already known and hasn't changed ever since. I wanted to become an entrepreneur. I
        was aware of the great obstacles and had to start simple, at first, I learned some hard skills, mainly
        programming. Since I started to learn how to program my life stayed the same, the only changes that occurred
        were a logical result. For example, I started to improve further aspects of my life and my mind gradually and
        drastically. I had a leading goal, called purpose which was my first app. I worked on it continuously and
        occupied myself with it. As a 14 and 15-year-old I used to be more masculine than I am right now, back then I
        aligned close to 90% of my life towards this goal, to a point where I wouldn't even bother talking to people let
        alone making my hair. I listened to no one since I knew quite well what I had to do and did that. I got rid of
        any negative aspects of the mind, got rid of any bad habits, built discipline, and was genuinely happy working
        towards my goal, my purpose. I didn't make my life easy at that time, I was productive 24/7. Until April 2023, I
        had bad habits mainly excessive YouTube shorts consumption yet the damage done by it was minimal since I had my
        goal and worked towards it. I never stopped working to pursue bad habits, otherwise, I would have suffered
        mentally. It just doesn't make sense to give up on the fulfillment you are getting from progress, just to
        indulge in bad habits. I wrote down the things I was doing every day since April and looking back, I miss these
        times. Every time I felt bad for example, I would simply do pushups…</p>

    <h1>2. June 2023 - Early September 2023</h1>

    <p>In parallel, my app, which I had aligned my life to started to show cracks, as a purpose. I ran out of ideas and
        therefore out of determination to do something. It started to feel as if my app had lost its #1 spot in my life.
        I used to think all the time about my businesses, and my YouTube channel. Always, I thought: “How do I get
        rich”, “How do I get rich” and “How do I get rich” Random ideas kept flowing in constantly. Using your
        subconscious mind to align with your goal is one of the most powerful tools known to man. If your mind and time
        are spent on your goal, it is the best form of existence achievable, I would say even better than spirituality,
        as it lays the foundation for it. This stream of ideas dried up because the #1 place of my conscious and
        subconscious thoughts got replaced. I fell in love with a girl, and this became the new thing to occupy my mind.
        I got interested in her a lot earlier (around when I started my current YouTube channel on March 23), but my
        businesses and apps still held their #1 spot, as I made great progress and felt genuinely better than I had ever
        before. </p>

    <p>I never intended to ask her out, because I didn't know that I was supposed to do it, because I got asked out multiple
        times by girls in my past years (and I rejected them), and my grandmother called me out for this nonsense,
        explaining that that's not the way it's supposed to be. I asked her out and got a “no” a few days later. That's
        when my suffering started, which I am trying to resolve, unsuccessfully. The following days remained constant,
        and I saw some improvements too, ironically. Firstly, I started this blog and I got great news, through
        relationships, someone from Silicon Valley offered me a job as a programmer. </p>

    <p>These things couldn't hide massive cracks under a carpet and I started to make further attempts to save the
        relevance of my apps. I couldn't. After a final attempt, I gave my first app a last chance by creating an ad
        campaign and it failed, that was in early September.</p>

    <h1>3. September 2023 - October 2023</h1>

    <p>In August and July, I didn't spend time on my app either and occupied myself with these blogs and other things
        instead, however, these blogs were unable to get the #1 spot in my mind instead I kept thinking about that girl
        that rejected me. Also, in September and October, I started to see the results of not having a purpose since the
        app got useless at doing so. Can you visualize how it feels if one thing you aligned your life to becomes
        redundant? I get completed so to speak, even if it failed from an economic perspective. It feels indifferent,
        almost silly. It didn't make fun to rest, because I was ready for the next thing already in the same week. I
        could not find anything new, because the #1 spot was still occupied. I knew the power of boredom to find it, and
        on Sunday, 22nd October I went for a 4-hour walk again and couldn't find it. From September on, my discipline
        and health declined rapidly in comparison to how they have been. I started to suffer mentally and with a delay
        physically too. </p>

    <h1>4. The only way to live</h1>

    <p>You know, discipline is important, getting up at 4 is, cold showers and constant learning too. But those things
        can't replace a vision because it's impossible for them to occupy the #1 spot in the conscious and subconscious
        mind. They help once you already have something to work on. This thing to work on is more powerful than anything
        as I have learned. You can have bad habits and distractions and still have high productivity if this goal is
        strong enough. It's even possible to get to a point, where you are the absolute outlier in a psychology
        textbook, as you start to act independently of what your hormones and neurotransmitters such as dopamine
        dictate. The power of the will is stronger and a purpose gives such a will. Working on the thing and aligning
        90% of your life to it is a beautiful thing. A mediocre person may have some purpose too, but chances are they
        don't dare to do what it takes. However, if you do what it takes, and sacrifice, you will think highly of
        yourself, if not you are starting to suffer. </p>

    <p>I disagree with almost everyone on everything as I don't think that these people have things figured out. That's
        called ego, arrogance, and confidence that comes with it. You don't need vacations and neither do you need to
        “enjoy yourself” As I went to Barcelona for 2 weeks in July, I didn't write a diary, because I knew, no day
        deserved to be better than a 2/10. Vacations have nothing to do with purpose, especially in their form of
        socially commonly accepted instant gratification. Enjoyment is supposed to come from work and not from resting.
        It being 5:17 and me writing this text is tenfold better than laying at the beach for 1 hour. The blog from
        August and September felt partly as if I suppressed these ideas, even though an outside observer may think the
        opposite. I don't believe in unproductivity and meaningless existence. Perhaps you think otherwise and enjoy
        vacations and weekends. I enjoy weekends because I work even harder there, not because I rest. It's inauthentic
        to enjoy not working on your purpose, as that's too feminine, and you already know it. The ideal life may be the
        standard version of what a 12-year-old may crave and more sophisticated men know, that this isn't right, rather
        the ideal life consists of hard work and discipline only. What sounds more like a perfect life, climbing every
        mountain in the world, running a large business, or looking forward to TV on a Friday evening while sitting with
        a curvy spine? Free time is an illusion too. It's either intense rest or intense focus, idleness isn't the way
        it's supposed to be. I wonder if that applies universally, but listening to others has done large damage. No,
        wasting time by not resting or not working hard is not good, it's a sin, and so is eating sweets. Do you want to
        sacrifice the ideal life for those things? How happy are you while being idle and wasting time? </p>

    <p>The only way to live is to follow your purpose and align your life with it.</p>

    <h1>5. Be willing to change everything</h1>

    <p>One day, someone asked me what my life was going to look like in 5 years. I responded that I had no clue how it
        would look. Follow-up questions followed and I insisted that I didn't know what my life was going to look like
        in the next 5, 10, or 30 years. I think she may have thought I'm inauthentic because I have “all the answers”
        usually, but here is the thing: I don't know. I only know that I will follow my purpose for the next few years
        and continue to do so for the rest of my life. Having a life plan was never something relevant to me. The
        mediocre life has a design. Kindergarten, school, college, job, family, retirement and eventually death. My
        plan, if you may call it so looks closer to this: kindergarten, a school with purpose in parallel, a university
        with purpose in parallel, 18th birthday. It doesn't make sense to write down “businessmen” as the next step,
        because it may be reached faster than expected. If I earn a decent amount of money, I will feel indifferent
        again and I will need to pursue something else. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to put on mental constraints.
        Thinking long-term is overrated in this scenario. Sure, you have to think long-term to achieve anything, trying
        to think of the next 10 years is impossible with this lifestyle. My current larger purpose is to get rich and
        financially independent. After this is completed, I will invest, so that the wealth won't diminish, otherwise,
        it will become a purpose again later and that's already the limit of long-term thinking in this context.
        Maintaining the tree of the previous purpose with minimum effort. </p>

    <p>“Mid-life crisis” refers to people who have completed their purpose of family and jobs and everything the system
        dictates. Family is important and doesn't have to contradict your purpose if you have been living following it
        for your whole life already. I sense that a new purpose I may have after I got rich and a family to move to
        China for a few months or years and I had this wish already a long time ago. In this case, why not include your
        family in this vision? I don't see any constraints there, except for financial ones. Do you think it's going to
        cause mental suffering for children? I can tell you from my personal experience, it doesn't. In case you are
        still unconvinced, remember the ego? If you don't follow your purpose, you will get sick, complacent, and slow
        down. That's not a good role model. </p>

    <p>When I was younger, maybe 8, I sprinted everywhere I went, jumped downstairs, and walked multiple steps at a
        time. I don't know if that's a fake memory, but I think I asked the after-school care why adults are slowing
        down. I don't remember the response and it doesn't matter. As I'm 16 right now, I see how everyone slowed down.
        No one jumps on trees or stairs, even not the other 18-year-olds in 12th grade. I still don't understand it
        exactly, but why do you think I'm listing it in this text? I think this slowing down is classical complacency of
        the mediocre person settling in and this is sad to see. However, I never slowed down, quite the opposite, I'm
        faster than any 8-year-old. You will find me walking up 3 stairs at a time at triple the speed with me not even
        getting warm. The complacency of the average person transcends everywhere. How you do one thing dictates the
        rest. Now you may want to point out that it's more elegant to move slower. I can tell you, that's total
        nonsense. Being muscular is elegant. A muscular person is elegant no matter if slower than the rest or trifold
        the speed. Additionally, you are not entirely wrong, as moving slower does indicate seriousness. In this case,
        slowness is not a sign of complacency, but rather intent or ego. To the greater picture that's irrelevant, if
        you are still complacent. Complacency is worse than you think, often people die right after retirement because
        you aren't supposed to stop!</p>

    <h1>6. Sacrifice </h1>

    <p>To give an example of the principle “Be willing to change everything” I faced a decision, 2 to be precise. </p>

    <p>I started to learn Chinese in the spring of 2021. At that time, I learned programming intensively and bridged the
        time between programming for beginners and my Android Development course. I wanted to avoid regret desperately
        and therefore it seemed obvious. It's said to be easier to learn a language while young (that's wrong in my
        experience, I think my 5-year-old self with average intelligence is nothing in comparison to my current self), I
        saw potential in China for future opportunities and knew that learning a new language will provide a new lens to
        view the world and make me wiser as a result by questioning common perceptions. </p>

    <p>I started to learn Chinese via an app because I couldn't find a textbook. Apps are more interactive than books
        and I was convinced. I started to learn Chinese for 2 hours a day until mid-2021. Ever since I practiced only a
        little, but every day. I have to say the compound effect is massively overrated. It never compounded, and
        mid-2021 to mid-2023 yielded fewer results than 3 months of focus. Learning Chinese was a good habit as I
        focused on it but it became a bad one as I got hooked by a streak and the leaderboard. A streak counts how many
        days you have practiced in a row and the leaderboard made me compare myself to other people I started to
        practice Chinese not for the essence of Chinese, but rather for these 2 things. That's when the progress
        effectively died. Do you remember the beauty of a purpose? Progress. It was gone. I felt as if this streak
        trapped me and made me do inauthentic things. I started to fear being offline, because of that app and it made
        my life worse by a lot as a result. But I had that streak… it would never get higher again, why should I quit
        now and not let the momentum build up in the next years? As I faced this decision a few days ago I
        wrote:<br><br>
        <em>“There
            was a time in 2020 when I thought that thinking long-term is a nice thing, and so is regret minimization.
            After
            having heard that my mother learned German in just 3 months, I decided to try the same with Chinese, already
            in
            March of 2021. I stayed consistent and never quit and sometimes I even went fast and practiced a lot of
            Chinese,
            especially in the beginning. That means I applied every principle so far… Currently, I have a 918-day
            streak,
            which means I practiced Chinese for 918 consecutive days. Overall, I had fun practicing, and learning bits
            of
            Chinese broadened my worldview a lot. A language provides a lens to see the world and since Chinese was
            beyond
            the ordinary, I learned a lot. 我觉得中文很不难。二零二一年三月我开始了。Sometimes, Chinese thoughts popped into my mind and they
            still do. Despite everything, I think, there is still a possibility I will restart learning Chinese, but
            with a
            difference, this time in presence and not with an app. It's not lost. I can still restart later, the lessons
            aren't going to disappear too fast, I have laid a foundation. Never did I regret letting go.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>For you it may seem obvious: drop it. But my brain argued against me. Be willing to change everything, that's
        what I have written. After a while of indecision, I made the jump in the cold shower and uninstalled the app.
        928 days. That's how far I have gotten. and after a few hundred Chinese words and countless spend hours, I feel
        bliss. I made the decision and I am happy about it. In a few days, I'm going to feel indifferent about it and
        maybe I'm going to sit down and watch the sunset and have tears in my eyes of gratitude.</p>

    <p>There is another thing that trapped me in the same way: it's my own app, and I let go of it too. I don't know
        what kind of coincidence it is, that on my birthday, I reached a 200-day streak. Now may I move on with a
        355-day streak.</p>

    <p>Never did I regret letting go. </p>

    <h1>7. Fulfillment as the goal</h1>

    <p>Happiness is an emotion, and it comes and goes like leaves in the wind. Sometimes there are more and frequently
        fewer, it's also the case that you decide to look at the leaves in the wind and decide what “many” means. </p>

    <p>Fulfillment is more permanent it's the feeling you get if you have been doing everything right for your limited
        time on Earth. If you live life to its fullest, work hard, stay disciplined, and genuinely give your best at all
        times, you deserve this feeling. Remember the cost of being inauthentic and not following your purpose.</p>

    <h1>8. Burnout isn't real</h1>

    <p>I have been, in the last 2 years through 3 smaller and 1 major burnout, in June. Everything I wrote about it is
        true. It made me focus on “better” than on “more” for example. It also shaped my further development to be more
        sustainable. It hurt to be less productive because it was a decline, as 2 purposes shifted and the 1st wasn't
        fully completed and the 2nd wasn't able to be completed. As a result, I started to suffer.</p>

    <h1>9. God is in control</h1>

    <p>Remember, that in the beginning of this text, I wrote that I fell in love with a girl and nothing started? Now I
        am ready to move on. I think I developed myself on a pace and scale which is almost hard to comprehend, hence
        the 2-hour daily walks. If that wasn't enough, it wasn't my fault. The main reason why the rejection hurt for
        months was because I couldn't handle who was supposedly better than me, with the assumption that she picked the
        best option. Now I know certainly that there is no one better than me. The only thing that spoke against me were
        my low social skills, but now I am confident that I figured it out. The other reason why it hurt maybe even more
        relevant. It's because I doubted that I could find a better option myself. That's a valid concern because I know
        myself, however here is an effective cope. </p>

    <p>Did you notice, that I placed a few coincidences in this text, coincidences, are impossible to ignore, because of
        their frequency and meaning. YouTube in March, the blog in June. 200-day streak and 10000th math task on my
        birthday. Have trust in God in things shall work out in your way. Every day, I pray for my progress. Perhaps it
        was necessary. There is certainly more to reality than meets the eye. You have to let go of resistance and
        attachment while being in the present and trusting the process. I don't know how else you can explain
        catapulting yourself forward by years and in most cases even by decades in just 2 years. The most progress
        happens when being open-minded and open to failure, not caring about results. </p>

    <p>Now you may be wondering why I asked out that girl, even though my first grand goal of financial freedom wasn't
        reached. On first glance it's counterintuitive, but it's necessary to avoid regret and to be authentic. If the
        current thing that's occupying your mind is that girl, it doesn't make sense to attempt anything else, as that's
        otherwise inauthentic - which creates mental suffering. Purpose comes in layers and the first layer has to be
        filled to unlock the new one. It's remarkable to wonder where some purpose comes from in the first place.
        Perhaps it's so deeply hidden, that it is only unlocked on a spiritual level. Let's get back to the real world.
    </p>

    <p>Going back to this scenario of falling in love and getting rejected by “the perfect girl”, there is a lot more to
        say, and I will make another text about it too as I think it's of great relevance to you. As I'm moving on, here
        is one thing that I noticed. It feels just the same as letting go of my first app. Remember, that you aren't
        alone. Regardless of success or failure, the feeling afterward is bliss followed by indifference. And here I am
        again, with no purpose, free. I will have to rediscover myself and I don't know what's it going to be this time.
        But I have faith. I am just at the beginning of a new purpose, a new thing to shape my life. I am nostalgic
        about my purpose-driven chapter and looking forward to the next one, one with greater recourses and skills.</p>

    <p> And maybe I am completely wrong altogher, maybe it's just a test from God and I shall learn the lessons before getting the
        results I desire. <br>
    
        I feel broken. I know, that thinking highly of myself and staying disciplined helps. I have a massively inflated
        ego and think to deserve more than everyone else, but now I am humbled. Humility is necessary.</p>
