    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Failure is temporary</span></h1>
    <h1>List of failures in the last 2.5 Years</h1>

    <p>In the last 2.5 years, I have experienced way more failures than wins. Most people know this rationally but still
        don't understand it fully. So, here is a list of things that failed in the last 2.5 years. Note that this is
        just an overview because alone in May of this year I had around 50 failures. Most of the failures are too
        insignificant to be worth your time.</p>

        <li>Despite writing 30 pages about different subjects in math, especially regarding random numbers and symmetry
