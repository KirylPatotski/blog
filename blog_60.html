    <h1>And I almost quit</h1>

    <p>After I lost focus for 2 weeks, I recorded my longest YouTube video so far, a combination of the texts <a
            href="blog_59.html">"Failures
            Kill"</a> and <a href="blog_59.html">"And then it hit me"</a>. It was the very first time where I talked for
        more than 30 minutes and it is the
        video where the speech was the best in any of my videos.</p>

    <p>For some reason, after I came home from school, I didn't start to edit this video, rather I worked on this
        reading tool. I procrastinated. Then I started to edit. Then “I have had enough” and tried to look up automated
        video editing software. Then it was already 17:22. A day wasted. I was overwhelmed by this video because of its
        duration and therefore tried to shortcut it and I almost quit. </p>

    <p>But then I remembered my own <a href="blog_6.html">texts</a> , and I regained focus by looking at the long term
        rather than the short term.
        In 10 years, I'm 26. My YouTube channel doesn't have to grow in 1 year. This liberated me and I took on the
        challenge of editing this video, this time with no shortcuts and fear, instead with a vision. </p>

    <p>In the end, this day isn't wasted - but well spent, even if just in the last few hours. Never forget where you
        come from and where you go. </p>
