  <h1>Why I never considered going into medicine</h1>

  <p>Every parent that has ever stepped foot on earth would have been proud if their children became a doctor or a
    medical engineer. When introducing oneself, it guarantees respect - rightly so. Medicine is not easy. Doctors
    sacrifice a lot for their profession and that deserves respect. </p>

  <p>Even my mother wanted me to be a doctor or a medical engineer. And that for a reason, I'm highly capable. Yet,
    medicine never interested me. Why so? That’s what I will explore here. I will share my arguments that reveal why
    careers in medicine are not a good idea in my opinion. </p>

  <p><em><strong>Who is this text for? </strong></em> To those of you who are not unshakably sure they want to go
    into medicine. If you are certain, then good luck with your path, and if you have been in medicine for decades,
    congratulations, and I hope your life is free of regret. But for those of you who are in a foggy situation, this
    text should be the lighthouse. This text is for those who have still a bit of doubt and are considering another
    option.
  </p>

  <p><em><strong>Why should you listen to me?</strong></em> I want to be a businessman. Above all, that’s stressful and
    will require me to give all of my energy daily. In that sense, being a businessman and a doctor is similar. Both
    require lifelong studying and true mastery lies within being a student. Sometimes everything gets reinvented. In
    medicine and high-end business, there will be moments when difficult decisions have to be made. Hence, business and
    medicine are similar. So, why should you listen to me? I thought everything through regarding my life and it proves
    itself correct. I live a decently exhausting version of life right now and observe myself. I also gained plentiful
    experience in making life-changing decisions, I planned my life a long time ago. Furthermore, I'm an experienced
    writer and thus have extraordinary reflective and rhetoric capabilities. </p>

  <h1>Let’s make a tactical decision</h1>

  <p><em><strong>The rewards are the same everywhere.</strong></em> It’s easy to get distracted with all of the status
    you’ll gain as a doctor. You’ll be easily in the top percentile of society. Doesn’t it feel great to feel recognized
    and doesn’t it feel great to help people while being paid well? But let us not forget that status and salary are
    relatively irrelevant. Helping people is also irrelevant. Why is helping people irrelevant? Because every job
    contributes to society. A teacher is helping society just like a doctor. Furthermore, recognition, status, a high
    salary, and the feeling that you help people and that you are useful can be obtained in any realm of human endeavor.
    For example, being a businessman brings you status, money, and a deep sense of purpose, i.e. feeling useful. Being a
    teacher brings those rewards as well. Even being a housewife can bring extraordinary fulfillment. You get used to
    the rewards of your respective career very fast and they don’t differ too much across careers, hence they are
    irrelevant. </p>

  <p><em><strong>What's at the center?</strong></em> Now, if all rewards are the same everywhere, what should you look
    at? At the center. Look at what you will be <em>actually</em> doing every day.* You must think of the task you’re
    supposed to enter a flow with. Look at your daily tasks and decide whether they excite you</p>

  <p><em>“As a doctor, I want to get in a flow while smelling blood and while chopping corpses. I want to study for ten
      years to neglect my future family just to get an even more exhausting job. I enjoy the hospital's piercing smell
      and its depressive interior design.” – text #119</em></p>

  <p><em><strong>Are you the right person?</strong></em> Frankly, I don’t know what kind of person wants to see
    suffering and cut flesh as their daily task in the first place. I can’t comprehend how someone can feel attracted to
    the pain of others. Not too long ago, I sat on a train and some medicine students were having a conversation. One of
    them was hot even, though she was a brunette. They were not talking about business, love, or even parties, instead,
    about what types of wounds there are. Are you attracted to that? I couldn’t do that and most others couldn’t. </p>

  <p><em><strong>Is the environment right for you?</strong></em> My parents, school, and everyone else wanted me to go
    into science. That’s the direction my life was heading. At 5 years old I was passionate about the universe and at 7
    about nuclear physics. It looked as if I was going to be a scientist. At the age of 13, I started to desire being a
    businessman and then at the ages of 14 and 15, I was a bit split between being a scientist and being an
    entrepreneur. But then, guess what happened? I had an internship at my local university and I hated it. I’ve been
    misled my entire childhood. There were multiple reasons to hate it, for example, the atmosphere, the design of the
    buildings, the tasks but also the people. Surprisingly, I had nothing in common with those other scientists and
    students. I could not see myself growing up to be such a beta. This is not personal, but I don’t like engineers,
    electricians and stem professors as people. The way I think and act is incompatible with that of a physics geek. I
    once wrote a 5,000-word essay on this topic, which is unpublished, so describing the differences further would break
    this text. But generally, do you get along with the people there and the atmosphere? Personally, I would feel better
    in a school than in a sterile hospital that has this piercing smell on a night shift. </p>

  <p><em><strong>Live by the deepest realization.</strong></em> You may be tempted to think that being a doctor is more
    than just worrying about wounds. Sure, being a doctor is also about filling out documents, but again, that’s every
    job so that’s irrelevant. If blood scares you a bit but you view it as the price for entry, you are lying to
    yourself. Seeing blood is the entire job, not a price to entry. Do not attach your ego to decisions and make them
    living by the deepest realization. </p>

  <p><em><strong>What are you doing right now?</strong></em> Why am I unshakably certain I will be a businessman?
    Because that’s practically all I do. For years now, I have started and finished projects. I started to develop the
    skills I need or will need. Analogous to this, if you obsess over medicine already, you should pursue it. If you are
    not obsessed with medicine already, chances are, you never will. You cannot choose what to develop interest for just
    as you cannot decide who to fall in love with. Do you want to do something that will not interest you or be together
    with someone who you don’t love? Exactly. So, you can’t know whether something will interest you at all. Sure, you
    can fall in love just as you can develop passion, and it is likely, but there’s no guarantee. If you don’t occupy
    yourself with medicine all day long already, it is not your purpose and chances stand against you. </p>

  <p><em><strong>Consider this.</strong></em> Finally, your self-awareness may be zero. This is to warn you. You can
    find out whether you have self-awareness or not if (1) things and feedback offend you, (2) you avoid responsibility
    and think that people are not radically responsible for their lives, (3) you don’t do sports (I mean real sports),
    avoid the hardship of any kind in general, (4) you are addicted to something, for example, you use social media just
    consuming, (5) you are negative, (6) you are a thinker or dreamer, i.e. like to be right and live in your fantasy
    and finally (7) you don’t realize that when you are tired or hungry your thoughts and emotions start to change. If
    you have zero self-awareness, all of your decisions tend to be harmful. All of that is because (8) you refuse to
    meditate, reflect, and to journal. If you cannot make clear decisions, you have a problem and no one can help you
    because self-awareness is rare. There may not be enough time left to summon self-awareness, but to sincerely
    reflect, you’ve always got time. </p>

  <p><em><strong>Finally, think long term.</strong></em> If you start to reflect, make the subject of your mediation
    your changing priorities. If you think that you can study with diligence today, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able
    to study for the next decade. There’s no guarantee you will not lose interest in medicine. Also, what makes you
    think that your priorities will stay the same? Now with 18, you may think that helping people in medicine is noble.
    With 35, that could be irrelevant and you’ll have to handle other priorities, especially as a woman. Now you may
    desire a bit of status, but I can guarantee this will change once you grow up. Further. Now you are likely to think
    that fulfillment comes from the job. Will you think the same with 50 or will family bring fulfillment with 50? Yet,
    with 50 it may be too late to change things. Especially with zero self-awareness, it’s impossible to predict how you
    will change. However, change is guaranteed. You can’t know what life is going to give you. That’s why it’s
    interesting. </p>

  <p><em><strong>Be willing to pay the price.</strong></em> And… let’s not forget being a doctor is hard. You can forget
    about family. Studying for a decade is a huge sacrifice. You have to be willing to pay the price. For a bit of
    status, that must surely be worth it, right? </p>


  <p>So, should you become a doctor? Well no, unless you want to give your life to this profession. If you are not
    unshakably sure, don’t do it. If you have zero self-awareness, be cautious. If you don’t enjoy flesh, blood, and
    pain, forget it. If you don’t occupy yourself with medicine all day long already, there’s no guarantee you will get
    interested in it. Don’t look at what your parents will think too much. Don’t look at the other rewards, because they
    are universal. If you don’t want to give your life to something difficult, there’s no point in trying to pursue it.
    Also, consider your changing priorities. Something difficult is only doable with purpose, with burning desire. Only
    with a strong enough why will you be able to stand almost any how. However, if you are uncertain, that ‘why’ doesn’t
    exist. Be willing to pay the price. Live by the deepest realization.</p>

  <p> *By the way, an internship has nothing to do with the real job. If you did the real job, you would be paid. You
    saw two weeks and not four decades.

  <p><em>Two days later...</em></p>

  <h1>Why I then went into medicine</h1>

  <p>A little twist of fate. Guess who is going into medicine.</p>

  <p>I never looked forward to university. As you may know, I don’t like people too weak to sit upright. Unfortunately,
    universities are full of them, especially in computer science. ----- Ever since the painful failure and consequent
    abandonment of my apps, in June or September, I never touched my computer since then. I noticed how I diverged from
    the identity of a programmer rather quickly. (More in the text ‘A new identity’) I’m now at a point where I’m the
    opposite of thinking like an autist, being awkward, and caring about digital stuff. The only remains from my
    previous self are a long list of little accomplishments, the time spent wisely on developing myself, and an
    inventory of skills coupled with powerful life lessons. ----- Returning to discussing university, as you might have
    guessed, my motivation to spend my life programming and studying computer science is zero now. Studying computer
    science was to please my parents, I didn’t believe in it since I was a decent programmer already and because all the
    businessmen I talked to advised against university. Also, did you know I want to be a businessman and not a
    programmer? Hence, studying computer science was to let time pass so that I could work on my business while
    distracting and pleasing my parents. ----- Today my mother told me that this computer science stuff is full of
    dorks* and that I would be wasting my life and excellent grades on it. Since my desire to study this computer stuff
    was zero and I did not see myself as a programmer anyway, I didn’t resist much when my mother said I should instead
    study ‘medical engineering’. Molecular chemistry/biology/engineering is not an option because I don’t want to look
    at 40 as if I'm 65, I don’t want to pay with my health. Medicine is not an option either because I don’t get in a
    flow while filling out documents and neither do I get in a flow while cutting people. Neither do I expect to get a
    crush on blood. ----- So, what is medical engineering? That’s dealing with robotic, radioactive, computer, and
    biological stuff coupled with math. Do I like sterile hospitals? No. But, the thing is, neither do I like recording
    videos and I still do it**. ----- Yet, I like the redemption, the sweet certainty that I will never be a programmer,
    surrounded by betas, or a geek myself. Furthermore, I’m sure I will like doing something real. Since my personality
    shifted so drastically, I'm glad I have something new and not something stuck to my old identity, I think, medicine
    matches who I am much more. ----- I don’t know if you know it or not, but I don’t care about most things. I only
    truly care about business pursuits, girls, health, and some of my family members. I don’t care about anything else,
    I don’t care about the opinions of others, and neither do I care about the weather. It is this exact indifference
    that made me open-minded and as a result, propelled me forward. Luckily, my mother cared about me since university
    is not business, girls, or health and I simply didn’t care myself. Luckly, I have my mother. Still, maybe I should
    have cared? ----- Anyway, now you may worry that I may up liking medicine and it ends up killing my exorbitant
    ambitions. Do not worry, I don’t believe that this is going to happen. I understand very well that it may to late to
    create videos just as it was too late to create apps. Instead, getting to know this stuff may save my ambitions
    since I hear of things I didn’t even know existed, with magnitudes fewer competitors. New things enhance creativity
    and enhanced creativity means better texts by the way. Maybe I will indeed end up working a job and not have my own
    business, that is likely even, but having a job does not mean one can’t tackle the impossible. ----- Furthermore, I
    think studying this will develop me more as a person***. I didn’t think so with this computer science stuff, I
    feared it would regress me. This medicine stuff has substance that strikes my curiosity, though I legitimately do
    not care about photosynthesis. It aligns with who I am and how I view myself and I'm much more convinced of that
    than before I started to reflect. And now I'm excited to go to university. </p>

  <p>*My mother does not speak like that, but I do because I mean what I say and say what I mean. It’s painful to be
    around these people, spare yourself of their way of life! </p>

  <p>**You will not understand. Why should you do something no one forces you to, where success is not guaranteed and
    not even expected, which you don’t like? If I only knew… I wanted to build an audience to make my business grow
    faster back when I was 13, … but truly, can that motivate me for so long? There must be something beyond it.
    Perhaps, it is the desire for darkness that originates from the dislike of boredom.</p>

  <p>***Also, today I started to wear sexier outfits and not those that would make one think my parents don’t like me.
