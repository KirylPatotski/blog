          (No good name so far)<br><br></strong>

        One must ask what one is living for.<br>
        Is it to be conscious or<br>
        to rush?<br>
        To indulge in sweet cognition of utility <br>
        to be trapped in agility, or<br>
        is it rapt to be free instead?<br><br>

        Things must not be rushed;<br>
        they take their time.<br>
        The sublime silence of<br>
        conscious-with-hands-crossed-sitting<br>
        is one's true priority, <br>
        it does not take much, it takes less.<br><br>

        Only a minority of people <br>
        dare to enjoy a silent moment.<br>
        The majority doesn't care, <br>
        they rather seek <br>
        to destroy the timid silence<br>
        because of what it may reveal <br><br>

        - the true master of one's life,<br>
        consciousness does not permit <br>
        one to be a cog,<br>
        Under the disguise of activity,<br>
        moving without one's will, <br>
        is true passivity.<br><br>

        Hence, stillness opens freedom and<br>
        one must ask what one is living for.<br><br>
      </p>
