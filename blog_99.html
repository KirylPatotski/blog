    <h1>A masculine life</h1>

    <h1 style="width: 100%;">Part one. Living a masculine life.</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Story one.</em></strong> A few days ago, I went for a walk in the mountains. It was a November day,
        the sky was white, the ground was grey-brown, the trees were bare, the air was fresh, the water ice-cold and it
        was quiet. I walked for 3 hours through the cold at that point and I stopped in the middle of the road. On the
        rear and van, the path continued, on the left grew a forest, and on the right, there was a scenery of
        chruschtschowkas with mountains fading in winterly fog. The wind paused, the bird's songs died off, the trees
        stood still and the people hid in their warm, comfortable houses. I made a step and then I stood still. It was
        quiet. It was so <em>quiet</em>, that I didn't even notice it, my mind slowly started to trick me into hearing
        something.
        Slowly, little snowflakes were falling on the <em>cold</em> ground without making a sound and the sky faded from
        white to
        dark grey as the sun set. I knew that I had to walk for 2 more hours from where I was at that point. My feet and
        hands were cold, yet I enjoyed it.</p>

    <p>Comfort isn't something I particularly enjoy. Every ordinary person likes to “rest” on vacation by just lying in
        the sun and indulging in instant gratification while overeating at the buffet. People say that you live only
        once, hence you have to enjoy life. I'm directly opposed to this, you get to enjoy life by living it, not by
        sinking in meaningless pleasure. Life is truly meaningless if you waste your time hiding in comfort. All of the
        pushovers are hiding inside their chruschtschowkas with comfort. They don't understand that discomfort creates
        growth. They don't understand that you aren't allowed to shower warm. They don't experience quietness and mental
        presence. Instead, they numb themselves with useless stimulation. </p>

    <p>Yet, it doesn't work that way. You must be fully present at all times; hence you must enjoy the quiet. Only the
        quiet or the boring allows your mind to progress to surpass everyone. Presence and consciousness are fundamental
        masculine traits, that's why the first that comes after discomfort. A silly person may interpret fairy tales,
        where an archetypical feminine woman gets awakened by a man as sexist. Well, perhaps no one ever told you that
        the masculine represents consciousness. Hence, meditation is vital. Meditation isn't something that adds life
        quality, it's something necessary. Everyone goes insane if not meditating. Meditation creates presence and
        removes almost every negative of the mind. You simply aren't stressed when you are sitting upright and taking
        deep breaths without any useless thoughts. Meditation allows you to exit vicious circles of your mind's
        negatives. It creates calmness and razor-sharp focus to outcompete everyone. Meditation allows us to practice
        absolute self-control. Self-control is vital to be of value, a person with zero self-control and discipline will
        fail in the face of the slightest inconvenience. Yet, most people lived their entire lives without meditating
        for 15 minutes, even once. Chaos is the spiritual feminine, men can't exist in chaos, meditation, consciousness,
        and discipline all bring order.</p>

    <p>Just be a bit calmer. There is no point in being overly emotional every time, <a href="blog_66.html">worries are
            illusions</a>. Make the
        best out of any situation and do as you desire. Live with absolute inner security and lay back. Some things
        don't matter and other things need to be fought for. You will need to learn to distinguish. Fear is holding you
        back. Enjoy the path more than the destination and discover more when you don't look at the results.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Story two.</em></strong> In this instant, it's 4:09 on the 27th of November and I have been awake for
        39 minutes and started to be productive right away. I thought through this text in yesterday's walk. Yesterday,
        26.11.2023, I woke up at 2:30, thinking that it was already 5:00 and I felt excited for this new day to start, I
        looked forward to being productive. I woke up at 2:30 and was genuinely happy. I must admit, yesterday I
        overslept and didn't get up at 3:30, instead at 4:30. I wrote a bit in the morning and the sun started to rise
        at 7. I looked out of the window and felt joy. After being busy for 4 hours, I got out of my room and ate some
        eggs and a decent portion of fish with butter for breakfast. By now it was already 9:00 and my mother told me to
        hurry if I wanted to go with them. They were going to the mountains, which are 2 hours away by foot and they
        went there by car to ride the sleigh with my younger siblings. Getting to the mountains by foot isn't
        particularly exciting, hence I joined them and we drove into these mountains. You could see how the snow became
        increasingly abundant as we drove uphill. After driving for 15 minutes, we arrived and I was free, I walked
        initially in the wrong direction, but then I got onto the right path to walk to a mountain village. The snow was
        deep in some places, up to 30cm and I fought my way uphill. In absolute quietness just like in the first story.
        After fighting myself through the frozen forest path, I started to approach the second village, and from then
        on, I started to approach the third and final village before I headed back home. At that point, I walked for 3
        hours nonstop already and after the 3rd hour, my feet started to get cold, but after I reached this third
        village, I walked through it and made me on my way home. I sat down in this village and meditated there,
        afterwards, I had to walk from that village to the lake using a dirt path. You must visualize how it looked
        there. The sun shone at a low angle from the direction of the mountains, on the van, there was a path optically
        leading to infinity, on the rear, there was a church and another village covered in yellow sunlight while being
        tainted blue from the winter cold itself. The sun shone brightly, and I felt joy, despite my feet being cold. I
        saw more sun than in the past month. I continued to walk and my feet started to get colder by the minute, I had
        to walk for 3 more hours and I arrived home at 15:00, after 6 hours.</p>

    <p>You see, every man has something inside of him and it's the drive to explore and to stay mobile, to live like a
        nomad. A masculine life will create unproductive misery if this drive is suppressed. There is discomfort that
        leads to growth, such as work and there is misery that leads to nowhere. Suppressing consciousness, the drive to
        explore, purpose, and the joy in discomfort for growth leads to misery. Imagine, what happens to your mind, when
        you don't see sun on your skin? Imagine if your mother suppresses you from exploring the forest since it's
        ‘dangerous.' </p>

    <p>A while ago, in spring, I asked my mother whether I was allowed to get up at 4 to go to the forest to enjoy the
        sunrise. She rejected me. Guess what I did? I went anyway. Do you think she was angry afterward? No, because
        what I did was right, and necessary to develop. You see, as a man you need to do the exact opposite of what your
        emotions and women tell you. When you feel like being lazy, you do what's necessary anyway. When you feel weak,
        go for a run, when you feel hungry, work. Don't be silly and harm your health, for example, sunlight is amazing,
        but that doesn't mean that you need to stare directly into the sun. If you dislike going to the cinema, you
        don't go, even if your future wife wants to. Trust yourself to get trust from women - don't make decisions to
        please her, yet be open-minded. When the temptations for harmful short-sighted pleasurable actions increase, you
        have to do the opposite and not indulge. </p>

    <p>There were many situations where I did the exact opposite of what I was told because I knew it was right. I stuck
        to myself and was proven correct at many points. In 2021 I was frequently told to quit the programming course by
        my mother and I didn't enjoy it, since it was hard. Yet, because it was hard and because others wanted to hold
        me back, the growth was even bigger after the course ended. Everyone hates work, yet I do the exact opposite, I
        embrace it. I'm living a fully different life from everyone if I do the exact opposite most of the time. Women
        don't tell you what they want. They will tell you how they feel at the moment, nothing more. Their complaints
        and worries are void, a symptom of a lack of love, just like any of their problems. Most of the time, they will
        complain just to gain attention, meaning love from you, hence I started to hug my mother when she started to get
        overly emotional. That made her life significantly better. Never force the feminine to make decisions, as the
        feminine wants to relax, for instance, my mother enjoys vacations. Likewise, women don't want to be the number
        one, as they get more joy from seeing their men/sons grow.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p><strong><em>Story three.</em></strong> This Friday, there was a special Friday and it was called black Friday. I
        told someone, that this is inauthentic nonsense. You don't gain anything if you buy some crap and this
        consumerism is destroying the planet and your life by enslaving you. </p>

    <p>Do you think he responded like a man? You already know how a weakling would respond and how a man would respond.
        Masculine men think for themselves and don't follow the crowd. They only follow what's authentic, and live
        partially outside the system or own it. You don't need to buy some nonsense; you need to learn how to live with
        less instead. You need to have the humility to admit being wrong since defensiveness won't propel you forward.
        Consumerism isn't authentic. Any book on masculinity will also go over this aspect; if you are masculine enough,
        shopping will feel painful. When I get a gift or someone buys me something it hurts my heart since I dislike
        input so much. Please never gift or buy me anything outside of necessities or if I ask for it. Shopping has
        nothing to do with absolute quietness and meditation, it's rather the exact opposite, it's comfort and noise. I
        would say, that's a price that comes with extreme masculinity; you won't ever be able to enjoy material things.
        The only material things I value are my diary, my computer, and my two cameras. Some other items provide joy as
        well, for example, my desk lamp, however anything beyond this mostly subtracts life quality. This lesson of
        extreme hate towards input applies to every area of life. The person who enjoys input will get fat and lazy
        later while numbing themselves with food and stimulation. Watching TV with food - that's not masculine.
        Generally, I have observed that consumption is a symptom of a lack of purpose or too much feminism. For example,
        my grandmother couldn't comprehend how it would feel to desire nothing material and she didn't understand how
        much the masculine dislikes those kinds of things. “Well, your ideas are nice, but you have to buy shoes.” Dear
        women, just because I need shoes doesn't mean I desire them! The man who is living the sensei kind of life
        doesn't think about new shoes either. The feminine wants to receive, while the masculine wants to give. Hence,
        mixing things up creates problems. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Story four.</em></strong> He said: “May I invite you to play video games or to watch video games. I
        brought my game console from Hamburg here” That was in July 2023, when I have been to Catalonia. “Well, no let's
        go for a run instead.” I intended to run 4km - 10km. He agreed and so we went. - He gave up after a mere 200m,
        and I wasn't even going particularly fast. This was a 19-year-old, the most submissive, feminine 19-year-old
        I've ever seen. He never sat upright or took shallow breaths, was awkward, and wasted his time on social media
        or playing video games. He swam slower than my 8-year-old brother. Guess how many girls asked him out - zero.
        And now he is perhaps sitting on his PC wasting time on social media with zero discipline while living with his
        mother, who isn't proud of him because he was unable to recognize that the feminine is simply a test, yet he has
        failed all of them. His mother felt like protecting him, yet she would have been happier if he broke free and
        was strong. </p>

    <p>Men need to dominate every area of life - no one cares about the weak. The masculine is in constant competition.
        Sure, look at your past self but remember that achievement isn't relative. It's a wasted life if it's lived like
        a loser. Life feels great at the top. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Story five.</em></strong> That's the essence of the last 6 months. I got rejected by a girl in June
        and it broke me, still, I haven't recovered. As a rather direct result, I let go of everything externally
        pleasurable that was remaining in my life and that was music and warm water. That means I was living an empty
        life, at least in the perception of most people. Yet, I felt happier than ever before, despite being deeply
        hurt. I loved extreme discipline - I excelled at being disciplined with ease, for it meant I excelled at being
        constantly happy. After living this extreme life for 3 months, my first app failed and I had to give it up. That
        means I lost something to work on, I lost my purpose. That means I got weak, to cite Nietzsche, “He who has a
        why to live can bear almost any how” - yet, the why got removed and I weakened. I got susceptible to sweets,
        something I quit already when I was 11, in 2019. “Well, eat that cake, otherwise you will suffer an immense
        burnout again.” Eating sweets didn't kill me, so I didn't stop. I lost my discipline which I worked hard for to
        get in the first place and it's impossible to be disciplined if the why is missing. This development got
        increasingly worse when the girl bragged about the loser, she spent time with to her friends. I had nothing to
        work on, which was already bad enough and then I got a bit extra unproductive pain. With a delay of a month, at
        the end of October, this pain started to add up, both of a lack of discipline, nothing to work on, and the other
        extra pain. So, I entered that extreme monk-mode phase again and after 2 days of the extreme variant, I'd
        written 39,000 words in 20 days, I had something to work on and felt happy again. As I entered this staring at
        the ceiling period, I felt great again. I missed discipline a lot. Let me rephrase it: it made me happier to get
        my heart broken while being extremely disciplined with something to work on than living a life with sugar. </p>

    <p>It's impossible for the average person how it's possible to live a life like that and I find it impossible to
        live an ordinary life. Most people hate their pathetic inauthentic lives and need to numb themselves. If you put
        me in a void room, I would simply be happy existing, while the average person would suffer, since their mind
        will tell them that they are living wrong. That's why most people don't have the discipline to deprive
        themselves of anything. There is a person who is reading this and thinking that they can shortcut depriving
        themselves while having extreme discipline. I can't comprehend how the average person can exist; they are
        challenging themselves to a meaningless life. </p>

    <p>It's generally the case that if someone is without a purpose, they suffer because the purpose gives strength. I'm
        going to enter a 90-day monk-mode period with the goal of 50 YouTube videos, starting December 1st. A decently
        feminine man would worry; however, I know that these are going to be 90 days of absolute discipline, progress,
        purpose, productivity, and happiness with fulfillment. Living at your constant edge is the only way to live as a
        masculine man. It feels precisely the same as being in love. That means one could argue that I love my work, and
        I do, despite it being exhausting and difficult. Since December 1st is close, I feel as if I fell in love again.
        If I love my work, why do you keep telling me that I should 'take a break'? I just described what 'taking a
        break' did to me. It removed the fulfillment of my life, by removing love. I love my work, why should I subtract
        that love from my life? Now, burnout isn't real unless you work 14 hours a day, which I used to do, so
        obviously, have common sense. However, you must be productive at all times; you must not waste time. If you
        can't work anymore, go for a walk.</p>

    <p>Going for walks is something fundamentally masculine as well. Do you think, Alexander the Great tried to work
        14-hour days? No, every ultra-masculine man dedicates a few hours per day to something called conscious with
        hands crossed sitting, staring at the ceiling, or however you want to call it. You aren't in a rush, because
        rush is the chaotic feminine. Stress gets redundant if you advance far enough. You don't need to waste your day
        doing little tasks with low returns, instead, enjoy the quiet, which brings us back to the first story. Here is
        a practical step. Schedule conscious with hand-crossed sitting time for tomorrow for one hour and discipline
        yourself to stick to it. You will be more productive if you spend some time doing absolutely nothing anyway. You
        aren't in a rush, things take time, great things even more. Think of the essence of life in that time.</p>

    <p><em>“There will be 2 hours a day, from 15:00 - 17:00, where I will do absolutely nothing, I will have the
            discipline to know when to stop working.”</em>- blog 94</p>

    <p>Another thing from this story is implicit, yet I know this to be true. I don't think I would have had any
        problems with overworking myself if I had spent 20 romantic minutes a day. Without someone to balance me, I
        would be overworking myself constantly. Rationally, I know that I can tell myself, it's all right, I will do it,
        yet someone telling me this with full conviction would be 10 times more effective. After all, I would have
        nothing to do except for work. I've already mentioned it, these next 90 days are going to be of absolute
        discipline and focus, even without music. I fear a few things, despite being excited about it. I don't fear that
        I'm going to overwork myself, because I won't do something for 14 hours daily, but I do fear leaving this phase
        on the 29th of February. When I upload the 50th video, “Negatives of the Mind”, I don't know what I would do.
    </p>

    <p>Moral behavior and strong values indicate high masculinity as well, as the divine masculine essence doesn't
        strive for wrong behavior. Morality teaches how to live right, hence a person who acts wrong is weak and wastes
        their life. Weakness isn't allowed for the masculine and neither is any derivative of it. Incompetence,
        slowness, stupidity, irresponsibility, a lack of control, and amorality. </p>

    <h1 style="width: 100%;">Part two. The only way to live.</h1>

    <p>Now you may be asking about the pros and cons of being ultra-masculine. I must say there are no negatives. Except
        that you become incompatible with most women and most men become boring. Another problem with being extremely
        masculine is that it's going to cause a lot of problems when suppressed and another problem with extreme
        masculinity affects your everyday life - imagine feeling deeply sad when someone buys you clothes, just because
        it has nothing to do with purpose and is wasting your time. However, I admit that what I just wrote is a bit
        controversial, because it can be debated if it's harmful to get sad over materialism. </p>

    <p>Beyond that, there are no problems, because being extremely masculine is the way a man is supposed to be. Your
        health, wealth, love, fulfillment, and consciousness all depend on how masculine you are, life only gets fine if
        you are on the extreme side of it. </p>

    <p>People in the middle will be unable to find those things, entirely. The feminist doesn't enjoy work, he does it
        because he needs to. However, the feminist has no chance against me, as I love my work - that also sets me free
        from the expectations of results. Mental health problems often are the symptom of being in the middle, because
        it's entirely misaligned with the nature of most people, hence the future alignment removes many of these
        problems. </p>

    <p>You are also healthier and less stressed once on the extreme side of the spectrum because people respect you more
        and even more importantly, you respect yourself more. Most people have already given up, and that's why no one
        respects them, especially since their self-perception is broken. If you spite yourself, because you know you
        aren't doing things right, you will feel chronic stress and you will lose everything that made life worth
        living. I find it sad to see most having given up already. Brother, work on yourself, have faith in God in
        things shall work out your way. </p>


    <p>Another extreme benefit of masculinity is that you have a lot more energy than everyone else - relaxation is
        a feminine trait. You must imagine an archetypical sensei. The sensei doesn't sit down while practicing the
        art of fighting, rather the sensei will fight so hard that he will master excelling at winning with ease.
        Every person who knows me in person understands precisely what I'm writing about. I don't fancy turning this
        into a highly spiritual text, but I will still speculate that this is the case, as you align yourself
        correctly with the universe. It will unleash infinite energy once you achieve harmony with the universe.</p>

    <p>Also, relationships enter a new level, because the attraction of two people on the extreme sides of the spectrum
        is incomprehensible to the person in the middle of the spectrum. Simultaneously, many people in the middle can't
        have relationships, because they don't need each other. After all, why does a balanced person need someone to
        balance them? The yin and yang need each other and they are in balance. Yet, the yang (white, masculine, order,
        day, progress) and the yin (black, feminine, chaos, night, destruction) can't exist alone and they are perfectly
        aligned with each other. Yet, a balanced person already has both sides, hence the person is unable to find a
        strong enough counter, while yin and yang can be combined, two grey circles can't be.</p>


    <p>Don't be angry if this text gives you a strange feeling, rather enjoy discovering your truth with the help of
        thoughts. Life will be missing a lot of its quality when lived in the middle of the masculinity/feminity
        spectrum. It takes strength to live a masculine life, as it requires your everything, you will only feel happy
        once living on your constant edge. It takes strength to stop suppressing your masculine side, yet the cost of
        suppressing it is large. There are 2 paths in life, the first one is to give up and numb yourself, and to suffer
        from being a loser the second one is to try your best at all times to become a winner. The choice is yours.</p>

    <p>In May and June, I went for walks at 5 am every day and I saw the sunrise regularly. On a warm Sunday in June, I
        went on a walk. I knew precisely where I would go. There is a bench and it's 30 minutes away
        from my home. I walked for a while in the summer spirit and sat down on a bench where I could see the sunrise.
        The sun rose and I felt its warmth. It was quiet, the fog faded away and the scenery was stunning. While sitting
        there, consciously, I felt pure bliss and I fancied my future, to the point where I got tears in my eyes. I felt
        happy for the life I had and for the life I had built. I have nothing holding me back, and everything is perfect
        - I'm excited to let my finite time pass. What a lot of people won't believe is that every moment can feel like
        this. In the presence of absolute annoyance, such as waiting for the train while sitting in wet winter clothes,
        I would still feel bliss. You shouldn't miss out on that. </p>

    <p>Right now, I sitting in my room and writing. The view out of my <a href="images/september_23/28.JPG">window</a>
        is magnificent, I love my work and I
        feel fulfilled.</p>


    <h1 style="width: 100%;">Part three. How to become more masculine.</h1>

    <p>You know, story two tells how I went for a 6-hour walk to think this text through. I didn't specifically think
        about this text, but rather about this third part. I must admit a few things here. Firstly, I always have had an
        extremely masculine character, yet I suppressed large parts of it in the past. I also think that it's limited
        how much you can change your masculinity because it's a very deep definition of you as a person, for some
        people, extreme masculinity or extreme feminity will create more problems because their nature doesn't align
        with it. </p>

    <p>There are a few things you can do to increase your masculine side if you have suppressed extreme masculinity.
        That means, this will unleash your masculine energy. </p>


    <p><strong><em>The environment, you have to subtract a lot.</em></strong> It starts with your environment and the
        chemical level. Until recently, I had acne and my sister and mother told me to use some cream and some
        ‘moisturizer' to counter this development. I refused and fought against it, I'm also grateful that I didn't use
        deodorant until I was 15. Now that I got older, I'm grateful for my past self for refusing to use any creams or
        any of that nonsense. The potential negatives of putting some synthetic (natural aren't necessarily better)
        creams and other chemical directly on your skin where they get absorbed include (yet don't have to be limited
        to) cancer, cardiovascular disease, development problems in puberty, behavioral shifts, mood swings, allergies,
        and finally hormone disruption. You don't have to blindly believe me, this knowledge is becoming increasingly
        widespread as more research gets conducted on it, so research it yourself. When you think about it, it becomes
        obvious that putting random chemicals on your skin is harmful. Many people need to take artificial hormones -
        maybe that's because they keep inhaling too many toxic fumes and have an unhealthy lifestyle in general? Maybe
        you are depressed because your paints are releasing hostile chemicals? You can see this in almost everyone, some
        boys are 18 years old and don't have to shave because their hormones are immensely disturbed. How are you
        expecting to become more of a man, if your environment fights against it at all times? Subtract as many
        chemicals as possible. </p>

    <p>It goes beyond direct damage done by creams or foods, for example, the frying pan you are using is using
        carcinogenic and hormonally active chemicals well. Plastics and plastic bottles are destructive as well, I'm
        talking from experience. Subtract plastic bottles, subtract synthetic clothes, and subtract junk food. </p>

    <p>What should you eat? Well, single-ingredient foods, or foods where you know every ingredient of, there are many
        legitimately healthy frozen foods out there. Let go of processed foods such as sweets, and let go of soy,
        sausages, and other things you know to be harmful. What you should eat and what not is very simple, ask
        yourself, did your grandparents eat it? Most of the food in the supermarket shouldn't even qualify as food, some
        chemicals don't have a name. Eat nuts, eggs, butter, vegetables, fish, meat, Greek yogurt, cheese, long-to-cook
        grains, olive oil, and that's it. </p>

    <p>Normally, it takes a long for health advice to take effect, but switching from plastic to glass bottles already
        proves itself to be effective after merely 48 hours. Let go of plastic bottles and synthetic clothes and
        fabrics, and subtract them from your life. Let go of putting your wallet and phone in your jeans, just use a bag
        for it. </p>

    <p>Subtract any bad habits, subtract digital addiction, subtract <a href="blog_63.html">traumas</a> and <a
            href="blog_77.html">mental health issues</a>, subtract things
        holding you back, it may even be that 'friend' who is holding you back. I want you to subtract something
        different as well and no one will tell you this. Subtract material objects from your life that are no longer
        necessary. Have the uncomfortable conversation you have waited for. </p>

    <p>There are a few more things you will need to learn to subtract, and those are the things, which you know you
        won't be doing for the rest of your life. A friend of mine asked me if I wanted to join him in football training
        and I rightfully thought about it for a while, and in my head, I debated, whether I should join, I knew that
        this is a sport and it would improve my friendships and social skills simultaneously, which is right even from
        the perspective of the old man. Then, I came back to my way of thought and remembered a lesson, a fundamental
        one. Don't pursue something temporary, or otherwise, you will be wasting your life, especially if that wish
        didn't stem from your desire and if the expiry date is already known. I didn't want to go to football on my own
        and if I joined it would be certain that it was temporary. Think of the scenario where you focus on temporary
        things - your life will be meaningless, and you will accomplish exactly zero. Let go of those things.</p>

    <p>Sometimes other things need to be subtracted and while subtracting, it's helpful to view the external and long
        term.</p>

    <p><em>Now we have finished subtracting, now we will add things. </em></p>


    <p><strong><em>Things to add.</em></strong> Put your face into the sun, direct sun for at least 1 minute a day,
        preferably for hours, and with more skin exposed. This reduces stress and brings your hormones and mental health
        into order. Reduce stress by breathing fully while standing upright as well. Sleep well and long enough.
        Meditate to clear your mind. Spend more time in nature in general and exhaust yourself by doing sports. As
        mentioned previously schedule conscious with hand-crossed sitting time for tomorrow for one hour and discipline
        yourself to stick to it. Add walks, meditation, prayers, and every other similar activity to your life. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Attractive girls.</em></strong> The next amazing piece of advice I want to give you is to talk to
        or to look at girls you find attractive, although it must be in person. I don't think I have to explain why it
        has to be in person because otherwise, I would be overusing the word “authentic.” It's definitely not like one
        of the defining aspects of my personality is the love for reality. They don't even have to be pretty; you just
        have to find them attractive. There is a girl who's a bit ugly, yet I still find her attractive. (She is not the
        one I typically refer to, but it's a friend of hers and I even secretly have a crush on her in parallel. If my
        sister is reading this, it's not the one you keep talking about.) Talking about increasing your masculinity, you
        must learn from my mistake. Never suppress your desire for the feminine. I don't regret suppressing my desire
        for women because it gave me time to build myself up, but beyond that, you will make more progress with support
        from the feminine. Here is an example.</p>

    <p>Notes from Sunday, 12.11.2023. <em>“I've done nothing noteworthy yesterday and sort of relaxed during the day. I
            went for a simple walk, finished reading a philosophical book, and did some homework. Then I went to sleep
            as usual at 19:30 to get up at 3:30 and that's what I've done. Then, when the day turned from the 11th to
            the 12th and the alarm bell rang at 3:30, I was already half awake. I got out of bed right away as I
            conditioned myself to, and had already prepared the task that I wanted to complete. I wanted to record a
            YouTube video on the text where I explained that the period between 1.12.23 and 29.2.2024 is exactly 90 days
            long. I wanted to learn what it felt like to record a video in the morning as it would become my new habit
            at that time. Yet, starting the day with the hardest task makes getting up even harder and so I continued
            sleeping until 8:00, meaning I slept 12 hours long. Now, what do you think would that situation look like,
            if I lived with a woman? Life is going to get 10 times harder because no excuses are allowed at all times
            and she will keep watching at all times. By the way, I did end up recording the video a few hours later, but
            that came at a lesson already obvious to me. No one else I know has such a story to tell yet it's all
            relative. Me getting up at 8 is the mediocre person's equivalent of getting up at 13:00. I've effectively
            sacrificed 6 hours of deep focus for nothing. Accordingly, that's how I felt.” </em> - <a
            href="blog_96.html">blog 96</a> “Motivation”
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Love your mother and get masculine friends.</em></strong> Another step to becoming more masculine is
        to get closer to your relatives, especially your mother. My relationship with my mother got significantly
        better, especially in the last 3 months because I started to hug her whenever she got annoyed. Not only that,
        but I started to take her in my arms and make her some tea. Additionally, it's vital to find real male friends.
        You will support each other and learn from each other. Surely, reading a book from or about an ultra-masculine
        person like Alexander the Great, or some contemporary spiritual book on masculinity may help, yet the knowledge
        in these books is always idealized and abstracted. That means masculine friends may help you to 'unpack' the
        abstraction into your personal life.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Become dangerously competent in every area of life. </em></strong> Exiting the spiritual realm. You
        must be competent as well, and I have already written a <a href="blog_73.html">text</a> on this topic. You must
        be useful, a incompetent
        person won't ever be respected by anyone. Incompetence will prevent you from being more masculine, since it
        limits the things you can do, if you don't know anything, you won't be able to dominate - that's kind of
        obvious. You get competent by finding a skill that provides a testing ground for life, that means, that this
        skill must have a core for example, programming or video editing, and many skills attached to it, for example,
        marketing, speaking, design, and so on. Additionally, your skill must be useful and decently hard to learn,
        which means knitting for example doesn't qualify, unless you knit to sell it and learn how to do business with
        it on the side. However, I would recommend a digital skill, for example, video editing, because the scale and
        utility are larger. After you master one skill it's vital to expand your view. If you climb a mountain, you see
        further and wider. Balance means, that you must be extreme in every area, balance isn't about being incompetent.
        Apply the things you have learned to master every area of life and not just the area of skills you could put on
        your resume.</p>

    <p>If you become competent, you will feel <a href="blog_70.html">conscious</a> and confident at the same time.
        Competence is also vital to
        becoming a high earner, which will create more freedom, remember that your dark side is always searching for
        freedom. </p>

    <p>There is more to life than leveling up the skill of making money, which competence often gets associated with.
        When you are young, this needs to be your priority, however, once you master making money there is no point in
        prioritizing it. Once older, you must also level up other areas of life, mainly the skill of love and
        spiritualilty.</p>

    <p><strong><em>It doesn't take much.</em></strong> Let's be direct here. Meditation is free and so is breathing
        deeply, conscious with hands crossed sitting, and the other great things I just wrote about. They don't take up
        much time, aren't hard, and neither do they cost any money, they rather save it. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Your mind controls your reality.</em></strong> The last aspect is the most interesting and it's
        called the mind. While your hormones influence your behavior, some individuals can break free from them and no
        one knows how. They can have their environment, health, sleep, mind, hormones, people and everything else
        misaligned with them and they will still be able to break free from any of those external constraints. They will
        change their behavior and mind despite the way their environment dictates. </p>

    <p>There is something about the mind that I would call a singularity, something that allows individuals to break
        free from everything. I call it singularity, because it doesn't exist outside the realm of thoughts, not even
        metaphysically yet you will still be able to feel its effects because God's logic predicts its existence.
        Seemingly, with no external cause, some individuals can break free from anything and no one can explain why.
        Unfortunately, that's rare. To give an example, that's like having brain fog by eating too many carbohydrates
        and still being able to think sharper than everyone else. That's like acting extremely masculine to then become
        it just afterward, at seemingly random. My whole life used to be misaligned against me, yet I was still able to
        create an app because my will was stronger than everything, even stronger than my mind. Changing your will
        changes you, so it's time to change your attitude. Changing your attitude starts with the control of the flow of
        information, and assessing every information you encounter, if it serves you or if it just implants useless or
        self-limiting beliefs. Some evil people rob hope out of people - that's harmful input controlling your reality.
        You can choose what to think and to believe. You must change your identity. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Masculine essence.</em></strong> . Don't wait for anything to get better, this moment won't ever
        come, and don't allow excuses to exist. Most people fall into the trap of waiting. “I will wait till the
        weekend, I have to finish school, I have to finish university, I have to find a job, I have to build a family, I
        have to save some money to retire, well now it's too late…” Find your purpose by depriving yourself of
        everything, until you find it. Use visualizations, boredom, and journaling, and then try those things out right
        away, don't wait for anything. A purpose must be something you love, you are good at, the world needs, and
        something you can be paid for. Compromising one aspect will create an incomplete life. Be willing to change
        everything at all times, and align your life to your purpose. You must live as if you were alone, free from
        anyone's expectations. Never change your mind to please someone, yet be humble and enjoy suggestions and
        criticism. Enjoy your insecurities because you may never have them again. How would you live if you were
        fearless and had zero complacency? You must live outside of your comfort zone; you must know your real edge and
        lean just beyond it. Reflect frequently, and optimize your day, don't mistake being busy for being productive.
        Be authentic and direct and give everything at all times. Know your dark side and learn how to handle it. You
        must accept that you are always searching for freedom. Embrace radical responsibility. Be competent, fast, and
        dangerous while being useful and morally aligned with strong values. Remember, that your history doesn't matter,
        you have to keep improving at all times, everything is relative. Breathe fully and stand upright. Finally,
        realize that your life will never be complete and that there will always be something to work on. Don't think
        you will sit down one day and feel like 'enjoying yourself', you will keep your life trying your best at
        everything.</p>

    <p>There is one final thing I want to give you on your way. Set your ambitions higher with everything. Let's say you
        want to start eating healthy. Level one would be to eat healthy food. Level two would be to eat healthy food
        that's easy to cook. Level three would be to eat healthy food that's easy to cook and delicious simultaneously.
        You don't want to become a billionaire, as desiring more and more money won't bring you anywhere. You want to
        set your ambitions higher. You want to be rich with a family or to set ambitions even higher, you want to be
        rich with a loving family and an amazing wife. As a man, you don't want anything except the best. Hence,
        fulfillment without the expense of other areas is the highest ambition.</p>

    <p>Becoming a man starts with meditation, time in nature, something to work on, and the rejection of comfort.</p>

    <p>Things I want to add</p>

    <p><strong><em>How to become more feminine.</em></strong> Now you may be unsure how to become more feminine if you
        are a woman reading. Well, you need to do the opposite of everything I tell you about how to behave. Don't be
        silly, you must cut out harmful chemicals as well, you must spend time in nature and you must control your flow
        of information as well, many aspects are identical. But instead of finding your purpose, you already have one,
        and guess which one it is. You don't need discomfort, rather discomfort will hurt you. But becoming more
        feminine is risky because you need to be masculine to earn money for example, yet this will likely cause
        problems because you would be suppressing your feminine side. Yet, having a man to take care of you puts you in
        a risky situation as well. </p>

    <p>The position for most men isn't a lot better, because they have to suffer from being a loser or they have to
        suffer from the pain it takes to become a man. The best-case scenario would be the essence of harmony, where the
        husband is amazing and you at the same time, yet harmony, is synonymous with balance and balances are often
        fragile. It's appealing to get to know a man early so that you won't get manipulated, you must be very careful!
        I must say, that I think to be able to afford my woman to be very feminine, however, I don't know if I will be
        able to protect myself from going insane or abusive, despite everything I have done to improve it, trust me, I
        have reason to think so. I simply don't know how I will be in 20 years, with 36. I have no clue. I also have no
        chance to know how my future wife will be in 20 years, with 38. Most likely, I will be able to resolve every
        inner problem soon, as the progress I've made is impressive. It's also possible that I will be able to heal
        every scar with the help of time and her love. </p>

    <p>However, if you are extremely feminine, you are more likely to attract extremely masculine men, who tend to be
        successful, so that means, being extremely feminine may provide safety. So, it's a very careful balance you must
        have. </p>

    <p>So how do you be more feminine? It's fairly simple. Be careful, sweet, dress accordingly, have good manners, be
        polite, spend more time with feminine women, be less aggressive, and be more loving. Though, don't exaggerate
        with empathy. Likewise, you must learn that you need to sit with your shoulders back just like every man would
        do it and chances are you aren't doing it right now. Embrace your emotions, put the responsibility onto others,
        and relax while learning how to be the biggest fan of your man. Put love in everything you do.</p>

    <p><strong><em>The billionaire.</em></strong> When I was younger, I aimed to become a billionaire, despite knowing
        that that's never going to happen, because I lack access to elites and you may point out that that's not
        necessary. Surely, everything has an exception. What I do have is a trait, or at least the tendency towards that
        trait every billionaire, without exception, has. </p>

    <p>In the history lesson, the teacher talked about the identity of nations and demonstrated what self-perception
        even means, she asked a bunch of students what 3 defining traits they have. I found out nothing new about the
        people she asked, but I kept thinking about this question. I would say, I'm a person set up for massive
        overcompensation, full of energy and with dangerous intelligence. </p>

    <p>The first trait is massive overcompensation, the defining trait of every billionaire, hence this life path seemed
        appealing to me. I'm not saying that I find materialism appealing in any kind, though, I must admit that the
        imagination of giving your absolute best at all times and beating everyone to an incompressible level with
        constant productivity while proving everything wrong to a point where every criticism becomes redundant matches
        also the image of myself that I have infinite energy and gets paired with the belief that I'm destined for more.
        I wouldn't want to watch me while writing this text, because if that person would just read “I am fully
        convinced that I'm destined for more” it may turn many people away, yet I think that I don't need to restrict
        myself in my blog. </p>

    <p>Yes, it may be true that every billionaire got there illegitimately to some extent and it may also be true that
        billionaires are no pleasure to be around. It may also be true that every billionaire is massively
        overcompensating, deeply hurt, and broken. Yet, I find these traits in myself, and as you can see, often they
        are very useful. There is no doubt that the life of a billionaire is one of the most masculine there can be.
    </p>

    <p>I have noticed that I could ease the pain and I could remove deep-rooted insecurities, yet for some reason, that
        massive energy still didn't go away and I still would be unable to live an average life. Billionaires may be
        sad, but there isn't any doubt, that they would be even more miserable, if this massive energy would be
        transmuted wrong, e.g., into alcoholism.</p>

    <p>I don't think that the deep scars in my personality will go away, or at least a lot more time is going to be
        necessary. Yet, the attitude of giving my best at all times while outcompeting everyone is still something I
        will always find appealing.</p>


    <p><strong><em>The next 90 days.</em></strong> From December 1st, 2023 until February 29th, 2024, exactly 90 will
        pass. I will cut out any remaining pleasure, warm water, and music and I plan to upload 50 YouTube videos.
        That's the essence of a masculine life. Discipline, discomfort, consciousness, purpose… and knowing your true
        edge and leaning <em>just</em> beyond it. </p>

    <p>Today, as of the 29th of November, my driving school ended and I must admit it was precisely as boring as I
        expected. </p>

    <p>When I truly reflect on getting up at 3:30 and every other lifestyle change, I must say that those were all
        correct. The texts past the 16th of October are of significantly better quality than ever before, in just 20
        November days I've written 39,500 words. That's something I could do for the rest of my life.</p>


    <p>...</p>

    <p>Grandmother, keep this text in mind when giving me advice. I enjoyed writing it a lot and I hope everyone enjoyed
        reading it.</p>

    <p>...</p>


    <p><br><br><br></p>

    <p><strong><em>My current situation.</em></strong> If you read the last few texts, you will know that there is a
        situation where I don't know if I want that girl or not, though I tend to a yes. I can't determine what I'm
        supposed to do. On the one hand, I know a lot of things, for example, I know that need love, I know that I must
        take the steps, I know that I must be certain and act, … But I also know that the woman needs to choose the man
        and I'm not sure if she chose me, I've already explained why in the past texts and I think that constantly
        reminding myself/her of what I don't like isn't too productive. Instead, praise is necessary. That's simple.
        I've seen things I don't like, yet if she stopped, how am I supposed to find that out? I'm just too scared, to
        paraphrase the essence of text #50; <a href="blog_50.html">failures kill</a> and build up fear as a result.
        (Another thing this text said
        is that I hesitated, failed, built up more fear and after 6 months tried again and failed regardless, I hope
        that the last sentence part won't happen. Yet, 6 months, that's also the time that passed now in this aspect,
        and don't that that's a coincidence, after all, every text was written with her in mind, yet don't know what to
        say beyond here, don't think that I lost interest in her to the current 15% on intent in the past month.).
        Everyone knows that fear and uncertainty are feminine traits. I'm scared and rationally and emotionally
        uncertain, hence I don't know what to do. </p>

    <p>Additionally, I have a bit of fear, because this text explains how masculine I am and how I think and live.
        However, I have the impression that some people think of me as if I'm stupid. For example, I didn't know that
        there was no school on December 1st until yesterday. I'm extremely masculine in my character, thought, and
        action, yet so far it only applied in my solitude. There is a chance that her imagination may break since I have
        no idea how to handle it in the presence of someone I love. (There is also the chance that her family is going
        to doubt my authenticity, which brings us back to the section of the billionaire because I know that that's a
        deep insecurity I have. That's especially problematic because of the things I say and do. “Well, what do you
        want to do after school” And my personality is kind of rare.) The other side may also apply, and she will get
        more feminine and I will get more
        masculine. Regardless, now you got to know me better and you've got to know yourself better.</p>

    <p>The biggest fear I have is the first date, specifically if I ask her some questions… I thought about this for a
        long and it has bothered me. It would be impossible for me to give my absolute best, if she hasn't picked me
        first, i.e., if she isn't a virgin. I must only hope that she is decent enough. If that isn't the case, I can't
        imagine how much pain both of us are going to be in. Unproductive pain, not pain that's causing growth. Some
        other things such as her social media use, parties, or male loser friend could be enough to make the first date
        fail, although not categorically. The only thing I can do is hope and pray.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Notes from November 30th. </em></strong> Well, guess what happened? I added a bit of certainty in my
        life, how great is that! How great is that… It is, in fact, so great that I'm sitting in my room in tears. </p>

    <p>I don't know what to think and what to feel. Today I saw her with that loser again. I don't know if anyone saw it
        - I started to tear up a bit and still greeted them. She proved to be unable to improve or didn't see the need
        for it, or perhaps, she only spends time with him because she feels a hole in her heart as well. However, she
        must get strong enough to break free. I could write a
        lot now, but I don't feel like formulating clear thoughts. I felt broken right away. I still love her, yet I
        don't know if want to be together with her, she seemed not to have picked me. Now I'm even less certain than
        before.</p>

    <p>I will gift you another masculine wisdom in a moment like this. Stand upright with your shoulders back, and look
