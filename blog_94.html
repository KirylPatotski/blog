    <h1>Happiest time of my life</h1>

    <p>Let's say you've read the last texts, from text 64 on. Here is a summary. From blog 50 to blog 64 some texts
        describe how my first app started to show cracks and text 64 provides the turning point, where every crack turns
        out to be true, my first app failed and I abandoned it. I lost purpose, and as a result, my discipline fell and
        I got lost. Ever since, I have been trying to return, more or less successfully. It's an extreme coincidence,
        but <a href="blog_64.html">“The Final Battle”</a> was exactly 2 months ago, which means, for 2 months I lived
        purposelessly and it created
        suffering, especially towards the end of October. I tried to restore my discipline and failed, also until now. I
        think I failed to restore discipline, because of fear and a missing purpose but today I discovered something.
    </p>

    <p> It's the 8th of November, and there are 22 days left in November. From December 1st, 2023 until February 29th,
        2024, exactly 90 will pass. That means, there is time to prepare for a time of absolute discipline. You could
        cut out harmful friends, sugar, and digital addiction in that time and I will cut out much more: music, biking,
        warm water, writing, and every type of internet except for email. Now you know about the event and you can
        pretend as if you never heard about it, and move on, or you could use it for some genuine improvements. I talked
        to someone and he is going to do the same thing, but start on the 29th of December, to end this period on
        catholic easter. Catholic easter Friday is on the 29th of March, and Orthodox easter Friday on May 3rd, 2024.
    </p>

    <p>I thought, having created over 90 blogs, I had enough material to prioritize YouTube again. Today I realized,
        that 54 blogs are left which I didn't create a video about, and which aren't photo blogs. Altogether they are
        around 6 hours of video material. I challenge myself to have the discipline to record 50 videos in 90 days. </p>

    <p>Yet, I will prepare by creating plans and by implementing everything else I talked about in the other blogs. For
        example, a strict schedule. Additionally, the tasks I talked about will find their time between 3:30 and 4:00,
        for example, reading in Russian and reading itself. Additionally, I will read one page of the bible per day,
        roughly the books Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus. There will be 2 hours a day, from 15:00 - 17:00, where I will
        do absolutely nothing, I will have the discipline to know when to stop working. I may use that time for social
        stuff or for chores. </p>

    <p><em>It's easy to underestimate how much 90 focused days will bring. Let me put it this way, what thing have you
            done that will propel you forward without exception for 90 consecutive days? How many days passed with there
            being nothing holding you back? </em></p>

    <p>I had 2 of these phases already, and they have no disadvantages. Yet, this is going to be the time when I am
        the most advanced. This is the life I want. I will be productive at
        all times, pushing myself slightly beyond my edge. In the next few days, I'm going to upload plans for every day
        from 1st December 2023 until 29th February 2024. Living beyond one's edge is what brings happiness to superior
        men. Working towards something meaningful makes happy, there is nothing better. Despite being cut off from
        anything normal people consider “fun”, I will experience a time of missing comfort and abundant prosperity. </p>


    <p>Plan (as of 9.11.2023)</p>

    <p>I listed 54 videos that I will record, and I decided to record the video I'm feeling like. Don’t worry, I'm not
        turning into a girl. It does make sense to record what video you are feeling like because it makes focus better.
        I decided that I would do the very short videos at the beginning and the 24th of February will be the last day
        where I record a video, I will record the text “Negatives of the mind”</p>

    <p>To give an introduction, the video which you are reading the script of right now, will be recorded on 16th of
        November. Furthermore, I decided to discipline myself to create short-form content, as people with a short
        addiction need self-improvement the most. I envisioned, that the mental health or digital addiction videos would
        be right in 10 parts each. </p>

    <p>I have no clue how much success, for instance, subscribers this operation will yield. I do know that this is
        going to be in the hundreds or thousands. Anyway, I have attached a pdf where I wrote down which videos I will
        need to record.</p>

    <p>To cite my last blog.</p>
