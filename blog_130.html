    <h1>My 2020 Vision</h1>

    <p><em><strong>Thinking long term.</strong></em> Why did I start to program, build an audience, learn skills, and
        everything else? - Because of everything I envisioned in December of 2020, as a 13-year-old. It all started with
        a conversation I had with my parents, where we talked about what I wanted to get out of my life. I decided to
        become an entrepreneur and from here on you know my story. I learned how to program, and jumped over 9th grade
        to have more youth, then it was already mid-2022 and I started to work on my apps, which I later differentiated
        into 3 apps, and in September 2023 I had to accept that they all failed and started to focus on getting an
        audience instead. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Unmatched perspicacity and sheer indefatigability, but with delayed results.</strong></em> I must
        tell you, until March 2023, when I already had been working on my app for nearly a year, I did not make my hair.
        I didn't dare to draw too much attention to myself. The stories I had to tell were too wild for anyone to
        believe them, hence, when I opened my mouth and also when I kept it shut no one liked me. Here is one such
        story, I was 13 or 14 and was wondering how much money I would make with apps after already having started to
        program. And this is perspicacity at its finest: I looked up every app I could think of and how much money it
        made. Next, I divided it by the daily active users, which you can look up as well. The result is two cents a
        day. Now that I've been in the app scene, I can confirm it's true. Two cents per user per day is nothing until
        you multiply it by a million, that's twenty thousand euros per day. It's a bit more complicated since some apps
        make that money times ten or divided by ten. Also, the profit margin varies between breaking even for startups
        and a third for large enterprises. I admit to knowing practically nothing here. However, the principles remain
        true. Such a story certainly didn't make me very likable. Hence, most of the time, I kept my mouth shut. You
        must imagine, that I was 14 in 10th grade, since I jumped over 8th grade, worked on my vision ruthlessly via
        laptop, played on my calculator, and excelled in school without trying. All while not being asocial, not even
        making my hair, thinking that all of the students two years older than me were complete losers anyway, thinking
        things so irrelevant I couldn't comprehend. I did not care about anyone, I knew that I just had to work on
        myself. When I did talk, they just heard me stutter, with acne telling these crazy things. When I got asked why
        I didn't have fun, I responded that I needed to make twenty thousand per day first, knowing well that even the
        second I got rich I wouldn't want to spend time with these losers anyway and also knowing that getting rich to
        watch movies is inauthentic. I would rather work. Talking about motivation? The prospect of making twenty
        thousand euros per day and all it takes is for the app to gain momentum is motivating enough. Other motivators,
        like trauma, were a sweet bonus. And that's how it's now been for a while. I worked on my vision, dismissed
        everyone since they wouldn't understand me anyway, and ignored everything else outside of my vision. Only in
        late 2022 did I start to become social and only in March 2023 did I start to make my hair. That is because now
        everyone sees that I'm the person I always claimed to be and I have plentiful evidence, so now I don't need to
        hide anymore. </p>

    <p><em><strong>I don't understand how in the world some people can sleep well at night.</strong></em> On Friday, I
        saw a supercar drive by, and it cost a quarter million. How poor people can just lie down and relax? I know
        about being happy with less, not being materialistic, spirituality, other goals or priorities in life, and so
        on, but I also know that you can't live aimlessly - saying that you don't need success in any realm is a useless
        existence for a man. Remember, philosophy is not sexy. Most people won't get that you need goals in life, even
        if they aren't deep ones. “The guy driving had low brainpower and is superficial”, some nerd may point out,
        “otherwise he would have never bought such an expensive car.” But I beg to differ, is the smart or stupid one
        making excuses? Having had an internship at my local university, it amazes me how some people can work jobs. I
        find it hard to comprehend how most can go to school, then to university and work their whole life for some
        random company, with the peak of their lives being a random party and with fries at a parking lot in the sun.
        Someone who gets a white-collar job is considered lucky by most. In a fast-food store, I've been to recently,
        most employees are not inexperienced students looking for some income, but rather fifty-year-old people who are
        desperate for cash. How can you live in stagnation? No one cares about these people, for some, not even their
        family members care wholeheartedly if they live or die. They live invisible lives. They can't do anything
        outside of hoping for danger to never come knocking on their door, knowing they would be too incompetent to
        handle danger anyway. They do everything wrong that can be done incorrectly. They occupy their mind with things
        they can't change, separate thinking and doing as much as possible, avoid reflection, and take no responsibility
        for their lives. When they think, nothing changes. When they talk, no one listens. When they shout, no one is
        scared. This is the reality for so many you may as well call it everyone. Everyone is a loser. Everyone is
        irrelevant, invisible, incompetent, and weak. “Maybe they just don't know any better.” You know what, I have no
        compassion with them. If they grew up in a different time and a different environment and didn't update their
        mind since then, they're retarded. The reality for most is hopeless and somehow, they sleep well. When I don't
        give my best to escape this reality that does not taste well, I can't sleep. I don't understand how anyone can
        live without a vision. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Did you know the world changed?</strong></em> Those who haven't had a mind update in the last thirty
        years, won't understand it, and those who do most likely won't act. The economy becoming more digital, making
        the transition from information-based to attention-based. It used to be, that if you knew how to smith and
        someone else didn't, that constituted your asset. You could exploit your knowledge of how to smith to make cash.
        Knowledge was only found at an oasis and was valuable. On the other hand, today we must sail on an entire ocean
        of information. Knowing something nowadays is practically worthless. Some random kid does indeed have a
        realistic chance of being a better programmer than a thirty-year-old. Consequently, if knowledge is irrelevant,
        what matters? Attention. That's why a 14-year-old girl can make millions shaking ass online. Certainly, most
        companies are traditional ones, for example, those that produce bread or oil, but starting a bread or oil
        company from scratch is almost impossible. Modern businesses exploit attention and it makes me sleepless. One
        such attention business model is the arbitrage business. There's a bus company and it doesn't own a single
        vehicle; it merely manages busses. Social media functions on the same principle. People create content, people
        watch content, advertisers do their thing and another company provides the computer infrastructure. Social media
        simply connects customers, consumers, and hardware, it doesn't produce anything. There's a platform for people
        where products are sold and the shop doesn't have any inventory, instead, it merely connects consumers and
        producers. These companies certainly simplify life - instead of a hundred blogs, there's a simple video-sharing
        platform, or instead of a hundred shops, there's one with everything. Apps are also part of the attention
        economy, you provide a platform where people and advertisers are connected. Next to connecting people, i.e.
        using arbitrage, there's also another type of business in the attention economy. Influencers.</p>

    <p><em><strong>I wasn't stupid as a 13-year-old.</strong></em> I knew that the golden age of apps was over. Now it
        is no longer possible to create an app, and for it to go viral. Coming up with an app that no one has ever
        thought of is increasingly more difficult and improving an existing app is not going to work if the existing app
        has a billion users. There are three million apps available to download. I was perspicacious enough to find
        that: Given that a million active users bring 20.000€ per day, they are great products. And given that there are
        hundreds of apps of any kind, you would need another differentiator for people to find it. Hence, you need an
        audience to build and then give the app to your audience. If you don't have people's attention, any product is
        worthless, unless you raise millions from investors.</p>

    <p><em><strong>That's where I am today.</strong></em> I've never stopped working on my vision, which was to get an
        audience and then monetize. I want to get my name out there and build something great. What changed is that now
        I try to gain an audience differently than I used to back when I was 13 and the app aspect is now taking a long
        break, or maybe it won't be apps that will make an ultra-high net worth individual. For example, a new way to
        monetize attention is via paid communities. Being an influencer brings cash too. I also now understand, that
        every business, especially the modern ones, has an expiry date, hence, my current pursuits won't be the final
        ones. While my methods changed, my principles didn't. My secret goal of 20.000€ per day remained, except that it
        took a hit in the months from September to February after I shut down my apps and had a few months of weakness.
        You know, all of this spiritual stuff, family, and so on are not something you can grasp firmly, you need
        something to do in your waking hours and an expensive car is a much better goal to have. I have tried
        spirituality and it made me miserable, read my blog! Now I have returned to a level, where I think, a girl to
        hug and to fall in love with would be nice, but I would rather work unless she is truly exceptional like the
        girl who rejected me. My biggest fear, that's also the reason this is only my 130th publication, and the reason
        why I didn't make my hair until a year ago, is not becoming successful. Not becoming successful means wasting my
        potential, being seen as a fraud, letting everyone down, and more so; half of that fear comes from disappointing
        my future woman. I find my biggest fear to be useful. If I genuinely fear nothing more than not succeeding, I
        will do everything it takes. I know that that's the right way to live for me, though, it may not be right for
        you. I know where I come from and where I'm going. </p>
