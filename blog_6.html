    <h1>Thinking long term</h1>

    <h2>I - Sacrifice</h2>

    <p>In December 2020 there was still a curfew in Germany, that's why I had plenty of time. After a single talk with
        my parents, they advised me to take action, because I told them, that I want to become an entrepreneur. It was
        that single event that transformed my life forever. Before this, I wanted to become a nuclear scientist or maybe
        a physics professor, but on that day, I woke up. My mother found a tutor from Belarus (I speak English, German,
        Russian, and Chinese) and she helped me to find <em>perspective</em>. She taught me how to get started with
        programming. My determination was gigantic. <em>At the end of 2020 I was 13 years old and I started to learn how
            to code</em>. Since learning real programming languages requires an IQ of 200, which I didn't have, I
        started
        by completing code tasks for 12 years olds, with JavaScript. <a href=https://code.org>code.org</a> I did that
        for
        up to 14 hours a day, even though one might say that code tasks for 12-year-olds are below my level, I swallowed
        my
        ego and still did it, as it was the only option. After around 3 months I completed every task on that website
        and on many others and my mind was ready to learn a real programming language, not JavaScript, which is used on
        this website. But something else happened. I programmed so hard, that I lost interest in programming. </p>
    <p>That was no problem. I emigrated from Belarus to Germany in 2013. After another single talk with my mother, she
        revealed that she learned to speak Germany from scratch in just 3 months. Having heard that, I was shocked, of
        course, I knew that, but for some reason, I wasn't aware of it, even though I knew that she spoke 5 languages. I
        went to the bookshop and wanted to find a book on how to learn Chinese üá®üá≥. I knew that I'm going to regret not
        learning Chinese while I'm young. In the
        bookshop, I didn't find anything, and that's why I wanted to use an app, Duolingo was the first result, so I
        picked it. To be fair, other apps offer only useless languages like Italian. Who needs to learn Italian? So
        right after I had burnout from programming too much, I started to learn Chinese. I finished half the Duolingo
        course and since I never stopped, I have an 800-day streak and can say quite a lot. </p>
    <p>After this purpose was fulfilled, I started to think more long-term. I understood that I need to create
        content in order to become relevant. In May 2021 I created my first video: Shortcuts on Windows 10. A couple
        more followed pretty quickly. Before I started <em>to learn how to code</em> I learned how to cook. In 2020 I
        made at
        least 130 pizzas. That's why I also tried to make culinary videos. Then, I decided to make more progress and
        purchased a real video editing software for 30‚Ç¨ (please don't). I made a 5-minute video talking about bits and
        data (it was without talking, only text with graphics and music). Then I made a second one about - China. I did
        that for a school project and also uploaded it to YouTube. It failed, because of copyright (I had no idea about
        copyright, I was 14). That marked a new beginning. I had 2 options I either give up or try something new. The
        only way to live is to try out something new. I started to create cinematic videos, after seeing this <a
            href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMiGjuCY0xE>YouTube video</a>. That became relevant much later. It
        was also the time when I decided to skip 9th grade, that means, I went form 8th grade to 10th grade.</p>

    <p>Only a few weeks later my Android programming course started. It was a Belarusian programming course for
        professional adults; therefore, it was hard. It took up around 12 hours per week from July 2021 to March 2022. I
        learned a lot and forgot most of it, but there was 1 thing that I learned: how to search the internet properly,
        an immensely important skill. </p>

    <p>At the beginning of 2022, I got my first GoPro, and after the programming course ended, I started to create a
        massive amount of cinematic, timelapse, and slow-motion YouTube shorts. I created 375 in just 2 months, got half
        a million views, and learned even more. After the views started to stagnate, because I ran out of ideas, I quit
        and started working extremely hard again.</p>

    <p>This time, I started to work on my first app, Helimath. Originally, I intended to make just a mental math app but
        then someone gave me the idea to include games. Because ChatGPT didn't exist and I had very little experience in
        programming I just worked until I no longer could - in the summer holidays for up to 16 hours a day. That's why
        the first version of Helimath was released on 28.8.2022.
        In the following months, I continued to work very intensely on my app, because obviously, it was far from done.
        I also created 70 YouTube shorts documenting my experience, but they also failed. In February 2023 my app could
        be considered done, and every additional development is only an improvement.
    </p>

    <p>Do you know what's beautiful? In February 2023 I also started going to the gym. In March I started to create
        YouTube videos, with similar content to my blogs.</p>

    <h2>II - Focus</h2>

    <p>In this story, I never talked about friends, women, hobbies, fun, or parties. That's because they didn't
        exist. I think it's very hard to understand for outsiders how that happened, but one thing is certain. A life
        like this is rare or not even replicable. This was just the last two and a half years - imagine what's going to
        happen once I gain more experience and everything will start to compound. </p>

    <h2>III - Imagine doing that for 70 years</h2>

    <p>An old man with grey hair may walk through the park and see young people doing sports, he is going to romanticize
        his youth and his little adventures while he himself was young and did that. Imagine if he never stopped. One
        classmate once told me, not too long ago: ‚ÄúIn order to achieve you need to live the life you always wanted at
        every moment in your life, live as if your life was final and immutable.‚Äù </p>

    <p>I can't stress enough how important this single sentence is, because you can derive a lot from it, it is as
        significant as <em>E = mc¬≤</em> for physics.
        What does it actually mean, to live life as if you reached its final form?
    </p>
    <p>Let's look at things that prohibit your take-off, and trap you to the ground. For now, I won't write about them,
        but later I will write a blog about every single one.</p>

    <h3>Things that limit yourself</h3>

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="blog_6.html">The short term (this text)</a><br>
            You have to think long term. That's how you get successful!</li>
        <li><a href="blog_5.html">Procrastination and Idleness</a><br>
            Procrastination is a drug that creates artificial stress and stress relief, which leads to artificial, cheap
            pleasure. Procrastination is caused by comfort and distractions and gets worse with time, just like holding
            something with your arms. <br> Idleness can be caused by laziness, comfort, and by fear. Idleness prevents
            any real growth because if you
            are scared, you can still do something anyway. Even if I was too scared to talk into the microphone the
            first time, I still did it, but that would have been different if I was lazy.</li>
        <li><a href="blog_50.html">Fear and Doubt</a><br>
            Fear is able to prevent real danger, but don't you think I was scared to talk into the microphone for the
            first time as well?y<br>
            Similar to fear, doubt can prevent real danger, but doubt itself has no real benefits. If you doubt
            yourself, so will others.</li>

        <li><a href="blog_12.html">Distractions</a><br>
            Focus in order to accelerate. Don't use the internet, don't watch TV, focus!</li>
        <li><a href="blog_12.html">Weakness and Comfort</a><br>
            Literally and metaphorically. Forget warm showers.</li>
        <li><a href="blog_62.html">Hesitancy and slowness</a><br>
            Ask and do, be fast.</li>
        <li><a href="blog_64.html">Incompetence</a><br>
            Read and do more. Obtain skills before doing anything else.</li>
        <li><a href="blog_69.html">Stagnation</a><br>
            If you did something for more than 300 times and you saw no results, you should change strategies. I created
            375 without success and that's why I quit. There is no point in continuing if you already lost hope!</li>
        <li><a href="blog_63.html">Unaccountability</a><br>
            If you always blame others and make excuses, how can you make progress?</li>
        <li><a href="blog_66.html">Uncertainty</a><br>
            I know for myself that uncertainty is one of the worst things; therefore, create certainty. Do this by
            creating deadlines, being accountable and asking questions.</li>

        <h3>Things in relation to others</h3>

        <li><a href="blog_28.html">Lies, Manipulation and unhealthy desire to Control</a><br>
            You need to face facts, be accountable and
            you shouldn't have an image you can't live up to!</li>
        <li><a href="blog_28.html">Unreliability</a><br>
            I asked nine people to fill out a poll, related to a new potential mental math app. I thought, this time I
            create the polls before I create another variant of my main app. Only one person brought it the next day;
            all the others constantly forgot it. How can you live like that, how could the other eight people be
            unreliable enough not to fill out a five-minute form?
        </li>
        <li>Coldness<br>
            Personally, this has been the biggest problem for me, since I had no empathy with anyone because of
            everything I experienced, but now I have almost fixed it because I took accountability and stopped making
            excuses.</li>
        <li>Revenge/Unforgiveness<br>
            No one cares, you damage yourself more than you damage the other person.</li>


        <h3>Things that limit your health</h3>
        <li>Bad habits<br>
            Bad habits compound, even simple once, you should stop them as soon as possible. But this process will take
            some time.</li>
        <li>Alcohol, sweets, junk food, ‚Ä¶</li>
        <li>No sports</li>
        <li>Incomplete sleep</li>


        <h3>Things that limit your impact on the world</h3>

        <li>You<br> Most of the things limiting yourself are inside your imagination, so the you can be your own worst
            enemy</li>
        <li>Focusing on minor things</li>
        <li>Adaptability</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>IV - The compound effect</h2>
    <p>Every small decision leads to big events and decisions. Every time you refuse to be weak, you have made progress.
        Every time you made progress, you shaped your future and changed it forever. Based on the previous chapter,
        doing something for as long as 70 absolutely shatters expectations. If you keep investing and learning for 70
        years you have no other possibility than becoming extremely successful. The old man would have a completely
        different life if he never stopped to do sports.
        Every decision compounds and that means, as soon as you notice a difference, the compound effect has given you
        enough momentum and is now accelerating harder than ever before.
    </p>

    <h2>V - Regret minimization</h2>
    <p>Let's say I wouldn't have skipped 9th grade, I wouldn't have started to learn Chinese, I wouldn't have started to
        code. Where would I be now? How could I be looking in the mirror having missed so many opportunities? Visualize
        yourself at your funeral. Don't just read this text, but try to implement what it says. Visualize every single
        decision, every significant and insignificant one. And now try to visualize yourself always being brave,
        hard-working, competent, secure, and with immense reliability. How would your life turn out?</p>
    <p>I can't exist simply in regret because regret is a feeling that can't be removed and will only get worse with
        time. Please take action TODAY, I or you are going to regret it. This could be the day you take control of your
        life and change it forever. The sooner you take action, the more impact your decisions have. </p>


    <h2>VI - Struggle as the way to happiness</h2>
    <p>In North Korean literature, most plots start with suffering, and suffering gets romanticized until the main
        characters realize that they are happy suffering and that suffering is the only way to happiness.
        Some people are only happy when they suffer.
    </p>
    <p>Why that's the case? Well, look at regret minimization, the compound effect, living your final life, and,
        shooting fast and precise. </p>

    <p>Suffering means growth, development, resilience, adaptability, and purpose. </p>

    <p>If constant growth is the only way to live in order to avoid regret and you need to live your life like you want
        to live it for the rest of your life, you will need to suffer. Hard things and desirable things take time and
        pain. And you need to <em>long term</em> and sacrifice.</p>

    <h2>VII - The only way to live</h2>
    <p>Every person that is looked up to or legendary never focused on minor things and distracted themselves. These
        people focused, were fearless, brutally competent, and lived their life to their fullest extent. In order to be
        happy, you need to get better every day. If you don't try hard enough, you will feel regret.</p>

    <p>Look at Felix Baumgarten for example. He shattered the world record for the highest parachute jump in 2012. He
        went as high as 39km (= 24 mi). That's the perfect example of living life to its fullest extent, without fear,
        without hesitation, and while growing.</p>

    <h2>VIII - Why and for what</h2>

    <p>At the end of the day, what are you living for? Are you living for cheap pleasure or are you living to try to
        become the best version of yourself and to leave an impact? You need to decide that. </p>

    <p>Suffering and growth give you a purpose to exist. It fills your life with something. </p>

    <h2>IX - Summary</h2>
    <p>The last 2.5 of my life were a complete sacrifice for later, I lived beyond my comfort zone, constantly learned
        and did everything extremely hard without any distractions or fun. Imagine living like that for 70 years, every
        decision will compound. You need to live your life as if it's in the final form and you need to start doing that
        today, until it's too late, because otherwise, you are going to regret it. Constant growth is the only way to
        happiness.</p>

    <h2>X - Final thoughts</h2>
    <p>First of all, I am very grateful for you reading this text and spending your time doing so. This story did not
        contain any tutorials. That's good the way it is. Not everybody needs to live beyond their comfort zone. I hope
        that this text has helped you to understand these extreme people better. View it from an evolutionary point of
        view, everyone is unique to contribute to society as a whole. It may seem, that these extreme people, or even I,
        contribute a lot more than others. First of all, simply more is visible and secondly, nobody chose to get an
        extreme life. Everyone got there because of their circumstances. I did not choose to learn 5 languages, to
        become an entrepreneur, to learn how to code, to start YouTube, there is simply no other way to live life.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I listed the things that are stopping my acceleration I realized, that I should be extremely grateful for my
        past self for fixing almost every and removing any obstacles. I did not regret sacrificing my last 2.5 years, I
        am very grateful for it. Every time I look at what I have done, I feel motivated to continue. But I have to
        admit that the time from December 2020 (I was 13) till September 2022 (I was 15) was so focused, that I did not
        socialize at all and simply cared about nothing else than progress. I am grateful for it, but that is not
        sustainable for a prolonged period of time, since December 2023 I also started to relax, and improved my social
        skills. In March 2023 I removed absolutely every single bad and my life has never been better. Now I also
        understand, that taking a break is sometimes the right thing to do because you have to think long-term.
    </p>

    <p>Thinking short term is the symbol of an unsuccessful life, the good news is, that this is simply a bad
        habit and can be fixed. I don't have any short-term thoughts anymore. If something doesn't affect me for the
        next 10 years, I don't even think about it. Let me give you an example. Every year from 1st to 10th grade there
        is a school event where every class plays sports and does athletics. 11th graders only document the results.
        Since last week I have been mapped to some discipline of athletics together with some girls. Currently it's
        Saturday, 10.6.2023 and I still know nothing else about it, even though I know that this event will be on
        Tuesday and Wednesday. I simply don't care about short-lived things with zero significance in the long run.
    </p>

    <p>Now that you are in the flow of reading. Here is one last thought:</p>
    <p>A grasshopper enjoys the summer and an ant works in the summer for the winter. Both may die. So, who is more
        successful, the grasshopper or the ant? In principle, there is no difference. Both are very common and very
        successful. Isn't that the same thing for humans?</p>
