    </h1>

    <h1>A reflection</h1>

    <p>Most people fail at everything they do. Most people are complete losers. Most people would be unable to fill a
        page with things they experienced this year. Yet, I have mastered this year. It was the first year where I
        wasn't a loser. I filled 750 pages. I'm ahead of everyone and this isn't even meant from a self-criticizing
        perspective, I mean it unironically and with full intent, because I have to make peace with myself, despite me
        knowing that arrogance is terrible. The story of my year will offend most people. It may sound as if I'm
        particularly arrogant and judgmental - yet this is one of the problems I got rid of this year. I can't believe
        the level of progress I've made in one year. I went from being an internet addict to a person who lives without
        a phone. I've gone from being a person who never made their hair to being one that's considered attractive. I've
        gone from being an atheist to seeing spiritual enlightenment. I've challenged myself often, and I learned a lot.
    </p>

    <p>Yet, despite every progress I've made, I've failed at my biggest goal, which was love. 2023 will be remembered as
        my first year of excellence and the greatest lesson from 2023 is that <em>failures kill.</em> </p>

    <p>Let's start slowly, step by step.</p>


    <h1>December 2022</h1>

    <p>I've been working ruthlessly on my app, on my mental math app, already
        since April 2022, after starting to learn how to program in December 2020. I didn't care about anything else, I
        hardly remembered that I went to 11th grade and I was 15 at that point. I worked so ruthlessly that I didn't
        care about anything outside of the work that brought me fulfillment, I didn't even make my hair. However, things
        started to change in December 2022. I started to improve my health in September 2022, and I built further
        skills. Hence, I strengthened my productivity which wasn't low to begin with. My productivity and
        just-doing-things-without-hesitation-or-fear mentality made me free, it made some time available and my mind
        could look at things outside of my work for the first time since December 2020, when my self-improvement journey
        started. In December 2022 my life changed forever, particularly on one evening when 3 now friends of mine sat
        with me on the train and we got into an authentic deep conversation about life. Furthermore, one other now
        friend of mine warmed my heart simply by accepting me and talking with me. If it were not been for him, I maybe
        wouldn't be able to make the developments I've done. I had serious mental problems at that time, despite my
        ruthless work mode. My ruthless work mode was so ruthless in the first place because of all the nonsense that
        happened in the last year, and for the first time, my traumas began to slowly melt away. All while my
        productivity grew even larger. Yet, I still had a bunch of bad habits. My internet usage was an awful 3 hours
        per day. 3 hours of mindless time wasted with a curvy back while taking shallow breaths. In December something
        happened that broke me. I've calculated the time of my precious youth I've wasted on the internet and writing
        down the number of 7500 hours while knowing that there are 8760 hours in a year, and knowing that it takes 10000
        hours to become a master, made me burst out in tears, I knew that I would never dare to touch my phone or the
        internet again. </p>

    <p>Yet, the journeys of productivity, social matters, and the subtraction of bad habits as well as traumas just
        started and it would take the entire 23rd year to win the battles.</p>


    <h1>January 2023</h1>

    <p>A journey of a thousand li starts with a single step. Yet, my progress in
        the realm of improvement started drastically. For one week I cut out everything holding me back. In the space of
        the internet which I used back then it was known as a dopamine detox. This is an intense period where you cut
        out every inauthentic nonsense to set your mind straight again. It means you let go of music, warm water, the
        internet, and any other bad habit you could think of. It was December 2022 when I took my first cold shower.
        Except, for one bad habit, sugar consumption is one I subtracted already in 2019 at the age of 11. I don't know
        which January week it was and it doesn't matter. What matters is that for the first time in my life, I
        experienced something that could be described as the feeling of a blooming flower meadow and it was tied to my
        creative output.</p>

    <p><em>“For the first time, I reached immense productivity, meaning I could brainstorm up to 70 ideas a day multiple
            times each week, and implement them because of advanced skills and lifestyle changes. Most of the ideas die
            after just a few minutes but one day in January was significant enough to be remembered for the rest of my
            life. On this particular day, Thursday 12th of January we had no school, instead every university had an
            open-door day and I went into a physics lecture in Dresden. Initially, I thought that my time would have
            been better spent at home working but something interesting happened. The physics lecture lasted 90 minutes
            and I got bored so hard that my mind started to go anywhere I came up with multiple good ideas, the most
            important being the idea of creating a mental math app for old people, as I saw an even greater potential in
            this idea, since old people are better software users. They are loyal, have a long attention span and their
            demands aren't so high because they are more grateful. Excellent, that mental progress is even more
            significant for old people than it is for young people. The same day in January I implemented the idea and
            was done after 2 weeks with the prototype.”</em></p>

    <p>In January 2023, I also quit my dev-vlogs shorts channel, after creating around 70 videos concerning the
        development of my apps, which I started in October, where I talked in front of the microphone for the first
        time. But this wasn't the first failure and neither was it a fatal one. The fatal failure would start in
        February.</p>

    <h1>February 2023</h1>
    <p>I started to go to the gym and brother, was I hesitant and awkward.
        Despite this, I trained harder in the beginning than I would ever again. I remember how I would train until I
        felt that intense gratifying exhaustion. I hated the treadmill, so it was the first exercise I'd done each of
        the five workouts every week. Yet, in February, I slipped back with the removal of my
        content-consumption-bad-habit, yet I've started to realize it was a problem and slowly started to gain control.
        I continued to work on my mental math apps, now of which I had two. My productivity rose even further because of
        the gym. Now I wouldn't just do 150 pushups a day while programming but I would also spend one hour per day in
        the gym. Yet, in February, the most important story of the 23rd year would start: <em>failures kill</em>.</p>

    <p>I had continuously improved my main mental math app, not the one for old people, which I talked about in January,
        and felt confident enough to start to advertise. I hesitated quite a long time, and then in the last days of the
        winter holidays I started by creating a simple ad campaign. I procrastinated a long time with this task because
        I was scared. You see, procrastination is not about being unproductive, it's about not doing the things you know
        will bring you forward. The ad campaign ended up failing and built even more fear as a result. It may not sound
        like much, but this failure would cause deep problems much later.</p>

    <h1>March 2023</h1>

    <p>This month I started to build another app, mental math specialized for
        the gym, it was done after a mere two weeks. Effectively, it was a lightweight version of my main app, yet made
        the main app significantly better, since it provided a testing ground. When the app was done, I started to
        <em>make my hair</em> for the first time in years, because I started to record the kind of videos I do now. I
        also started to write regularly in my grey notebook. The first video that I didn't delete had a funny background
        and it's my whole personality in one sentence; I got the idea to record a video on how to become more creative,
        so I turned on the camera and took a pencil and this notebook and brainstormed ~30 ideas in 7 minutes to use as
        background footage for that new video. In March, there would be another story that began here and would stretch
        across the entire year, more or less visible. My sister told me, that there's a girl that matches my description
        of the perfect woman.
    </p>

    <h1>April 2023</h1>

    <p>April was the month when my year began to its full extent. On April 2nd I
        completed my transformation to get rid of all bad habits, finally, I stopped using the internet and being
        addicted to it. April was a rather intense month. My notes also start from here on. It was also in April when I
        started to attend business lectures, for a school project, related to improving my apps. That's did I, and I
        created polls and ads that hung in the school for example. I like my tutor, she was so supportive that she asked
        me if I would like to distribute the polls in the class and was curious how my channel was doing. Although, my
        internet usage would drive up temporarily as I got sick in the middle of April. I remember precisely the night
        before I got sick. Remember December 2022? One of the fronts achieved a breakthrough. After a few years of no
        progress and a few months of a broken surface since December, I was able to get rid of every trauma I've
        collected over the past years. You may be curious how I did that. I'm not hesitant to be authentic, I got rid of
        my traumas by imagining telling everything to the crush I developed just two or three weeks ago. I didn't expect
        anything and wanted to go to bed like a person (I almost would have written like a <em>normal</em> person) and I
        kept thinking about everything that had happened in the past. I've thought about how I got bullied, how I
        bullied others, how we were homeless, how I've lost my home … And I retold the story in my mind again and woke
        up with a fever, but for the first time, I woke up with a mind free of any traumas. I had no unpleasant thoughts
        coming back regularly ever again. I don't know, maybe a crush is a simple replacement for a trauma. Enough time
        passed and I the transformation came on its own - the art of not trying. In April 2023, I saw a YouTube video
        that would change my life. Looking back, I started to watch self-improvement videos in January or February 2023,
        yet this one was the final one I needed and it was titled “Monk mode.” It helped me to stay focused for the
        upcoming months. Anyway, in April 2023, I freed up my mind, and since I completed the transition to get of all
        bad habits, I became more productive than I've ever been. I constantly thought to myself “How do I get rich; how
        do I get rich” and my mind gave me ideas. My creativity continued to be on a level I'd never seen before, just
        like in January. For example, I came up with the idea to complete 10,000 math tasks to promote my apps. And I
        also got the idea for a project, which I never mentioned anywhere. </p>

    <h1>May 2023</h1>

    <p>Meanwhile, my productivity grew larger by the day. I've kept building skills,
        I liberated myself from hostile cravings and bad habits, I had infinite drive, I had a goal, and my programming
        got even more productive as I started to use this AI stuff. I started to improve my social skills for the first
        time actively, after breaking free from all of the traumas. </p>

    <p>May 1st would start at 5:00 for the first time voluntarily. I had a productivity never seen before. Here is a
        story representative of my experiences in these months:</p>

    <p>One May morning, it was 6:20 and I had ended a project I started at 5:00 because I was so fast to try out the
        idea and fast to kill it since it turned out to be undoable with my resources. It was an idea I gained in that
        boring physics lecture in January. That's what speed means. Every day looked like this, and I mean every single
        one, I have documented them all. On another day I would not kill an idea but instead brainstorm 70 ideas for
        texts, videos, or features for my apps. Whenever I didn't kill an idea or got life-changing ideas, I would
        simply go for a walk at 5:00 and also a two-hour walk at 17:00 after the gym. I remember how I spent good chunks
        of my time writing in my notebook with a pencil, just like in April. I wrote many texts fundamental to my life,
        for example, the one titled “Life is paradise” or the creativity guide I wrote back in March. </p>

    <p>So, what was the other idea next to the 10,000-math task challenge from April? It was an idea to use the 375
        short videos and thousands of clips from spring 2022 and to remaster them with my current editing skills and the
        new footage to create a countdown of 256 videos, of which the final one would be an ad for my app. My life is
        full of massive coincidences. I got the idea for the 256 videos on April 21st, which means, if I started right
        away, I would end tomorrow, on January 1st, 2024. Yet, I picked May 1st as the starting point instead.</p>

    <p>May was my favorite month, despite it going downhill from the middle.</p>

    <p>I also feel like writing down that my family forgot my 16th birthday and only congratulated me after I came back
        from school. Yet, there was another now friend of mine who congratulated me as the only one. But the middle of
        the month went downhill anyway. Did you know that I have a strong distaste for travel? My sister was “busy”
        (which I find offensive because my output is magnitudes larger than hers) and that's why she didn't go instead I
        was forced to spend some time with my family. You may not know it, but I'm not a pleasant person to live
        together. Because I'm exactly how I describe myself in these blogs. If something has nothing to do with
        progress, I reject it. For example, yesterday (30.12.2023) my mother told me that she bought my favorite sweets
        and I told her that I don't want to be a fat loser. Or someone told me recently that how I sit offends them and
        I thought to myself that this person is going to fail at anything they will do, imagine getting offended just
        because I don't have curly back. So, our trip went to Vienna and lasted from Wednesday to Sunday. Brother, did I
        distaste it, every moment of it! Yet, that's, of course, judging using the things I've written down and my
        feminine attitude doesn't matter anymore, instead I remember how in Austria it was enough to eat and to drink
        once a day, taking food and drinks with you is useless. Surprisingly, May was the first month, where I became a
        bit depressed. Normally I get depressed if I travel with my family for a few hours or while there, yet I
        disliked it so much that I never recovered…</p>

    <h1>June 2023</h1>

    <p>Long June lasts from May 22nd to July 6th. In retrospect, everything that
        happened had to happen. Although the first months feel completely logical and consistent, it is this period
        where the consistency stops and everything just becomes too complicated.</p>

    <p>After coming back from Austria on May 21st, I had a few more amazing days. 9/10, 9/10, 7/10, and the 25th was
        already a 3/10. I subtracted that 256-day project on the 22nd of May and slowly, my productivity fell. But
        before my productivity started to fall, I became a bit depressed. On the 29th I wrote in my diary that too much
        happened too quickly for me to handle. You see, my skills were high, my life was aligned in my favor, and my
        drive was infinite, hence I think I might have overworked myself. And failures kill, there were around 50
        failures that added themselves up over the last months, some of which threatened my existence. Also, my creative
        drive ran dry. So, I felt a bit down, and it became no better after I was too much of a pushover to ask out the
        crush from March on June 1st, despite deciding to do so on May 1st.</p>

    <p>However, you should not get a wrong perception of that time. Every day still looked like a motivational story.
        One day at the end of May, I thought during a walk, just like in April, “How do I get rich, how do I get rich?”
        and I got the idea to add a new feature to my app that would normally be considered to be a premium one and I
        implemented it right away. Other days have similar motivational stories.</p>

    <p>On June 1st for example, I went to the gym and ran faster and further than I have ever done and I forgot the keys
        at home and only realized it while returning. I thought that my family was home, as both cars stood there. I
        rang the door, yet no one opened, so I drank a bit of water, threw the gym stuff over the fence, and went for a
        7km run, that means, I crushed 2 records that day. Little did I know that walking 15km per day would soon become
        the norm, until November. Turns out, my family was home and simply no one heard anything. </p>

    <p>On June 2nd someone who knows me sent me a story that is an allegory to my life. It warned against life without
        gratification, and I was such a little bitch that listened to it and I even cried after reading it! It was an
        allegory that was about an old woman who never “enjoyed herself” while young and kept sacrificing her life until
        she became old and realized that she lived a life without enjoyment and regretted doing so. This would make a
        mark in the future and this wholesome story would make me enter the darkest period of the year, in September.
        Anyway, a day doesn't consist just of a story that takes 5 minutes to read. On that day I realized that my
        creativity ran dry which I maintained and grew from January to May. I had a good mind and thought to take out
        the camera to record my process of regaining some ideas and it worked, as I went on a walk. </p>

    <p>Then, my grandmother told me that I shouldn't be a pushover and ask out that girl. But before that, there was
        another massive change that occurred. “How do I get rich” yielded a further idea. I must start a blog for my
        app, although I then decided to make the blog centered around living right, similar to my YouTube channel. So,
        on the evening of Wednesday the 7th, I got the idea and by noon of June 8th, I had published 3 texts. That's
        what speed means by the way. I'm amazed by how many coincidences there are in my life, both the times of the
        blog and the channel match with <em>her</em>, March and June. Then, on June 9th I went on my typical 5 am walk,
        knowing
        that I would ask out that girl today. The weather was perfect and it was beautiful to go for walks in the
        morning. I had seen her for months on a Friday morning, but guess what? On that morning I couldn't find her.
        Then, after thinking about whether I should wait until Monday to ask her out in person or whether it would be
        better to ask her out via text, I decided not to hesitate.</p>

    <p>Dear reader, now you have been reading what my life looked like in 2023. Back then, everyone already knew that my
        life looked like this, everyone saw that I skipped 9th grade or that I try as hard as I can in everything I do.
        I also rejected 3 girls myself in the previous years, so what do you think happened? </p>

    <p>She rejected me. I couldn't believe it. However, she didn't write “I don't like you,” which would have removed
        any interest within days, instead, she claimed to already have a boyfriend (I find that term silly, but that
        doesn't matter in this context) and this was like radioactive waste in my mind. I simply didn't know what to
        think of that information. I'm the only person that sits upright, how can there be someone better than me? There
        simply isn't anyone who can tell that their 23rd year looked remotely similar, because 99% of people find it
        noteworthy to remember going to the cinema. I considered my social skills to be low, but in June I've already
        fixed that problem as well, that's why I waited so long in the first place. The more people I get to know the
        more I realize how special I am. What remained was a question mark. </p>

    <p>June was one of the last times where I thought to myself “How do I get rich” and instead thought permanently
        about that girl, her rejecting me made it no better.</p>

    <p>Actually, in that time, my productivity recovered from the end of May and I continued just fine with my
        productivity. I started to feel better than at the end of May, yet this bliss was temporary. On June 14th I was
        so frustrated that I decided to use that energy to subtract even more, for example, music and another bad habit
        I've been struggling with which I couldn't get rid of completely. Then, on June 18th my productivity got a nail
        in the coffin because the question “How do I get rich?” gave me a new idea, a new algorithm, which I knew I had
        to prioritize over my apps, yet the progress was little. That's when my real burnout started, until early July I
        would do nothing, I would do no more than stare at the ceiling with discipline I've never had before. This whole
        crap of burnout transformed me forever. It made me focus on excellence rather than on more. I got to know my
        true edge, which was 2.5 years of 14-hour days with no rest. </p>

    <p>Long June ends on July 6th, which was the Thursday before the final school day in 11th grade. On July 6th I went
        to swim with a few friends and classmates in the lake in the morning. Then, we went to a useless event, because
        we had to. Then in the evening of that day, the same group and a few more went to the same lake and we slept
        there in the clear summer night sky. </p>

    <h1>July 2023</h1>

    <p>On Friday the 7th of July we biked back to the school to get our 11th grade testimony. I was a little pushover
        again because I wanted to ask one of my friends who I know a lot better for advice, although, I then didn't ask
        for help, because I was too scared, at least, I can justify myself by saying that the girl that rejected me
        showed no interest in me and tried to avoid me as hard as possible. I got my school certificate and it was the
        best semester ever, because I got my first mark B in May in ethics class, when it came to discussing
        utilitarianism, women's, and animal rights, so no wonder I performed poorly. </p>

    <p>July is a month that presents a motivational story on its own, and it presents one of the key lessons of 2023:
        Things take as long as you want them to. I knew that I would be going with my family on a vacation to Catalonia
        for two weeks, starting on Thursday of the summer holidays first week. So, I thought I better get productive. I
        tried to record two videos, one about setting priorities and the second video about quitting music. Yet, my
        speech was so poor in these videos that I got tired of editing and instead decided to delete the second video.
        Instead, I saw this as an opportunity. I would speak in front of the camera every day for 5 minutes, meaning for
        70 minutes in total. I've said to myself that I'm not going to prepare, otherwise the learning effect is going
        to be lower. So, remaining unproductive, I did not do a lot in the days until July 13th when the two-week
        vacation would start. There was one notable thing: I got a new camera, which I used extensively before Catalonia
        to get used to it.</p>

    <p>The trip itself was boring. I didn't go to the gym, because I got sick on July 6th and the gym in the hotel
        wasn't a real gym. Despite this, I enjoyed how many women looked at me at the beach and especially how many of
        their boyfriends did. Although I rarely went to the beach, because I don't see how that has anything to do with
        the spiritual way of life. Instead, I read and went for walks. Spain was very ugly. The houses were in poor
        condition, there was stinking rubbish and degeneracy everywhere. The mountains were littered and there were
        unfriendly people everywhere. In Germany, many houses have a carpet which says “Welcome,” but instead in Spain,
        the fences said that the police is going to be called when you enter and a dog is going to kill you, all while
        the people had cars no more expensive than 3000€. The infrastructure was in bad condition, gypsies were trying
        to rob you everywhere. My mother wanted me to socialize, hence she wanted me to spend time with the most
        submissive curvy-back-mentality 19-year-old I've ever seen. We also went on 3 trips to Barcelona and a boating
        tip. I didn't like the trips too much, yet the last trip, was with my sister and without my family, so I liked
        it.</p>

    <p><em>“In Austria, I was basically without food or water, except for breakfast and some fish bread rolls. Noticing
            the positive effects of this fasting, I maintained the same thing for Barcelona, (but I did take water with
            me). So, completely hungry and exhausted we drove back from Barcelona 1 hour to our hotel via train, the
            train was crowded and we had to stand. The train tracks were parallel to the beach and the world was in
            golden light. There it hit me: vacations with all their relaxation, idleness and abundance force you into a
            meaningless and purposeless existence. But also, not everything can have meaning, so there is no reason to
            dislike vacations. So, I thought about why I hated vacations in the first place: I came to the realization,
            that I didn't dislike vacations themselves, but rather being trapped and unfree without autonomy to do what
            I desired.”</em></p>

    <p>Now you may be misled into thinking that I learned a lot during these vacations and trips, yet when you look at
        my blog, I've written 1000 words on this vacation, while I've written 2100 words over a random day like December
        1st. I do have some beautiful memories from the vacation in Catalonia, for example, it was nice to explore the
        mountains and it was nice to maintain hard discipline. </p>

    <p><em>“During this vacation, I resisted any bad habits even though it was a vacation, I never ate any sugar for
            example. This is a very powerful lesson, invisible at first, because it means, that I can stand true to my
            values even if there are massive temptations everywhere. Because everything applies to anything, it should
            be clear that not cheating on yourself in tempting circumstances will result in you not cheating on others
            in any circumstances.”</em></p>

    <p>When we came back and I recovered from the nonsense called “vacation” I tried out my new speaking skills on the
        29th of July and wrote 2 blogs, recorded 4 videos (of which only 2 made it), created some pretty pictures of my
        room, created a cinematic video for my older channel, read an entire book, started to write another blog,
        practiced speech and went to the library. Finally, I gained my productivity back which I lost in May! Trust me,
        this would perhaps have happened even faster without the vacation.</p>

    <h1>August 2023</h1>

    <p>As you might have noticed, every text of mine has a background which is to impress that girl that rejected me,
        yet when reading over my own blog, I noticed that I never mentioned what I did to impress in August, during the
        summer holidays. </p>

    <p>My typical day consisted of getting up at 5, working until 13:00, resting, eating lunch, 16:00 gym, and from
        17:00 - 19:00 walking. I meditated a lot and came closer to the spiritual way of life that I have ever been.
        What did I work on? Almost every day I wrote a text, took many pretty pictures, and walked paths I'd never
        walked before. I had two internships. One was related to the business lectures from April, as this professor
        wanted me to help on a project of his and I did. I outworked them all, in one day I did as much they would do in
        10, while working for only 6 hours a day. Previously I thought that I was extremely arrogant for thinking that I
        was 10 times ahead of everyone but this confirmed what I was thinking of myself. I did not enjoy the internship,
        because they were treating me as if I was a little girl, despite me shattering expectations and proving my
        competence. I would be telling them; “That's not how it works, it's not well thought through. I would recommend
        you to do it like this instead” and they had their defensive attitude. I thought, if they are so smart, then
        they don't need me. In parallel, I had a second internship with a guy I met in Catalonia. He was a decent and
        welcoming guy and I felt respected. I enjoyed this internship, yet then the project failed, so I got redundant.
        Also in August, I was working on my website, a web version of my mental math app, yet it failed. In August I
        also executed that 10,000-math task challenge, from April. It took 11 hours. In retrospect, it was a lot less
        significant than I expected it to be. In August, a friend of my crush invited me to her birthday as well as my
        crush, and I was hoping to get to know her better in that time, but this party was canceled. I was disappointed
        because I kind of started to miss her. In August, I also set my blog as my WhatsApp info.</p>

    <p>Failures kill, that's the main lesson of 2023. In February it was clear that I was going to try again to
        advertise my apps. Now I've gained a lot more experience and until early June I continued to develop my apps. I
        hesitated, built up fear, overcame myself, and tried in February. After failing, I've built up even more fear as
        a result and this failure set progress back for months, hence failures kill. I want to comment here that my
        grandmother didn't want me to call the story “failures kill”, yet that's the best wording I could find for my
        favorite story. In August 6 months passed and I was ready to retry. Slowly, I sat down to find new ideas and I
        made preparations, most of them were the mental kind. Then, I've been to a little business competition where I
        pitched my apps and won. On the train ride back, in golden light, in blissful aesthetic, I finally set up that
        ad campaign after hesitating for 6 months. I published the story on August 20th, the last day of the summer
        holidays, so short August ends here. By the way, in mid-August, I started to listen to music again. </p>

    <h1>September 2023</h1>

    <p>On August 21st, I saw my crush again and she seemed to not care about me in the slightest, so I thought that she
        had already forgotten about me and that nothing was ever going to happen. Additionally, I could feel from other
        girls that I gave off the impression as if I lived on my edge my entire summer holidays. Also, in late August I
        had the fear that I would run out of things to write about, and I couldn't be any more incorrect. In the second
        week of the school year, my teacher wanted to talk to me. It wasn't the best news that I'd heard. Remember the
        business lectures in April? Well, the ads and polls that I created were encouraged by the business professor and
        the teacher because I documented everything for a school assignment, which was a 35-page paper about the
        business aspect of my apps. Yet, the teacher warned me that it was not going to work, and perhaps mental math
        apps were not valid concepts. Hence, I thought I may have nothing to lose. I attempted the final battle,
        effectively an extension of failures kill. I created many ad videos and graphics… to advertise for the last
        time. I gave it one more try, this time with a lot less hesitation. In the lunch break of the second Thursday, I
        would put the ads online. </p>

    <p>Around a week later I had enough. I saw the numbers and my first idea, it died. I felt a bit of bliss, because
        now I was free, free for something new. I cut the rope I wore for years and used a metal chain instead, which I
        still wear. I rested a bit and went on beautiful walks. I was so happy that I didn't burn out again despite
        failing so hard. After a few days of resting, I worked hard on my second app, the one from January, math and
        memory for old people. I added sports and workouts to it and after it was done I tried to advertise for the
        second app as well and the app gained no traction. </p>

    <p>I used that free time to focus on the spiritual way of life and in September I truly transformed as a person,
        faster than even in April. During one walk in September, I changed within 3 seconds entirely. In April 2023 I
        started to meditate and it changed my life forever. During that walk, I saw spiritual enlightenment. In these 3
        seconds, you notice how much everything is an illusion and you feel as if you are just an extension of the
        greater reality, you see that you don't see the world but rather a projection of it created by your brain. You
        realize how insignificant you are and this insignificance sets you free, it removes any fear. Since then I've
        stopped thinking useless thoughts, and effectively I'm in a permanent flow. That's why the quality of the texts
        past then was elevated a lot. Now I can maintain a flow while writing for 6 hours without even looking away ever
        once. While talking to people, I don't have a voice in my head and just say what I authentically think. </p>

    <p>To contrast spiritual enlightenment…You see, failures kill. I lost my discipline after my second app died as
        well. I had little to do anymore. I felt miserable. The failure of my apps is something I would never recover
        from, there will never be no “before the apps failed” anymore. I lost the iron grip I had on my life and became
        weak. And not even the spiritual enlightenment could help much. What do you need a flow for, if you have nothing
        to do, if you have lost the work, you've worked years on and constructed your life around? It certainly didn't
        get better as I've heard my crush bragging about a degenerate loser and what great of a guy he is. I couldn't
        believe it, until late October. I'm writing to make peace with myself, so one more thing that happened in
        September the instant I lost the iron grip: I lost interest I've had for a second girl, which I had interest
        from May to September in secret parallel. Let's go back to June. Do you remember the story of the old lady who
        sacrificed her life? Well, now I didn't sacrifice anything anymore. Now I 'enjoyed myself.' “Well, eat some
        sugar, otherwise you are going to suffer from a terrible burnout again.” “Maybe rest a bit?” “Life isn't only
        about work.” I became susceptible to weakness and to what others were telling me, I used this as an excuse.
        Normally, I thought for myself and didn't listen to others unless realizing that they were correct. To cite
        Nietzsche, “He who has a why to live can bear almost any how” - yet, the why got removed and I couldn't bear any
        how. I got susceptible to sweets, something I quit already when I was 11, in 2019. Eating sweets didn't kill me
        so why should I stop? The pain of eating sweets, after all, was greater in my imagination, than in my mind. In
        September, my class and I went on the final trip of 12th graders and we went to Venice, and I enjoyed the
        journey, yet my weakness got no better because I was bombarded with weakness everywhere, everyone told me that
        it was ok to eat sugar and I got congratulations as I took my first sip of alcohol, despite repeating when I was
        13 that I'm only going to drink alcohol when I become a multi-millionaire and even then, only once.September
        didn't end nicely.</p>

    <p>I'm not built for pleasure; I'm built for the fulfillment that comes from living on my edge.</p>

    <h1>October 2023</h1>

    <p>October had a terrible start, middle, and end. On September 29th we came back from Venice and on September 30th
        my family and I went to Turkey. I begged hard not to go, as I hated trips with my family as this text should
        make abundantly clear. For one week we have been to Turkey, near Alanya and Side. I hated every second there
        because contrary to my previous holiday in Spain or Austria I indulged in sweets. It got so weak that I begged
        God for an improvement on my knees. </p>

    <p>The middle of October was marked by me attempting to go back to the days that once were or to at least make my
        future version of myself proud, yet I simply was too much of a loser to do anything. At least, I went on pretty
        walks in that period, and during my walks, I even saw my crush and it gave me a bit of hope. You see, the
        pictures I've taken in October are pretty. Yet, I didn't like looking at them, because they were a portal in the
        time I despised. Should have never listened to my grandmother and never done something fun and instead sat out
        the time, just like I did during my burnout in June. In the middle of October, my great-grandmother and
        grandmother arrived from Belarus and I saw no improvement to my situation either. On October 22nd I then decided
        to go on a long walk again, for 4 hours. I wanted to think about my situation. Halfway into the walk, I made the
        mistake of drinking out of a cold stream source, this has made me sick within 5 minutes.<em>And grandmother, I
            do not care that you said it took longer than 5 minutes to get sick!</em> I decided that I had enough of
        having a crush on that girl who showed that she has no interest in me and I almost let go. Yet, when I published
        the text where I described letting go, suddenly she started to stop pretending as if I didn't exist and started
        to show interest. I felt like I was being taken for a ride by destiny. Yet, simultaneously, I saw her with the
        loser she bragged about in September, so kind of the worst situation happened, the biggest fear turned out to be
        correct. Even if they don't have a relationship and are just “friends” I don't know what I should think of
        destiny, because he isn't so far ahead of me that I need to be scared, rather he is a spiteful, lazy loser, who
        has neither social skills nor intelligence and is physically weak. So, I don't know what kind of radioactive
        waste of a lesson that is. No matter how hard you try to think about it, it just doesn't make sense. </p>

    <p>In the end of October I was declining, yet I was smart. Being smart is about learning fast, so I saw that I felt
        just before my burnout, despite being unproductive, so I just took 2 days off and did absolutely with absolute
        discipline, starting on October 26th. Ironically, I didn't lose interest in that girl and I don't know why. </p>

    <p>You see, past September, every month is an expression of<em>failures kill</em>. I simply couldn't recover from a
        failure so large. </p>

    <p>But then, I thought: I'm smart. That means I learn fast. Maybe, it's my arrogance that was holding me back? I
        never lacked gratitude, because I always express it even for the smallest things, for example, if my mother goes
        to buy food. Yet, this can be viewed as fuel for arrogance as well, “I'm the only one who is grateful, so
        clearly you are all losers!” It's easy to be proud, especially if you look at the lives of others. Yet, comfort
        isn't something I desire, do I? Being prideful served me well in the past, but then I decided from one day in
        October to another, that arrogance is useless, it has nothing to do with a spiritual way of life and thus I must
        subtract it. Done. But not entirely. Throughout this text I'm arrogant, but you must view this as an attempt to
        make peace and to let go.</p>

    <p>That's not the only thing I let go of in October, I also let go of “learning” Chinese with an app, which I
        started back in early 2021. October was also the time when I let go of getting up at 5, instead at 3:30 and
        these decisions were great in retrospect.</p>

    <h1>November 2023</h1>

    <p>November was still unproductive, in comparison to May, yet it had some improvement. After the two days of doing
        nothing followed 2
        weeks of not using the internet. I was also a bit sick because of the situation and because I may have drunk a
        bit too much cold water. Yet, being sick and not going for walks or to the gym and the weather being terrible
        gave me some liberty. It allowed me to have a month of writing. After these 2 days, I've written 39,700 words in
        20 days. Although, almost every text I've written in this time had a decently strong tie to her. For example,
        one text is about quitting the internet. I constantly kept overthinking if I wanted her or not.</p>

    <p>In mid-November decided something related to failures kill and it's still hanging on my wall. I decided to regain
        my discipline by creating a time of absolute focus from December 1st, 2023 to February 29th, 2024. I had the
        goal to create 50 videos and to read the first three books of the bible.</p>

    <h1>December 2023</h1>

    <p>In December I changed a lot too. After 11 years of being a vegetarian, I let go of it, and I realized that
        leaving my apps on the internet was holding me back so took them down to make peace with myself. I've now
        uploaded the 27th video. From June till December, 6 months passed and I gained the courage to ask out that girl
        again, yet this didn't happen because she rather spend her break with that loser. This was in the last December
        week before the Christmas holidays and it gave me the most depressing Christmas I've ever had, so 2023 was a
        great year, but without a great end. My conclusion on that love story is that I'm not going to try to move on
        and neither will I try to enter a relationship myself. I will wait which turn destiny is going to take. </p>

    <p>Although…</p>

    <p>In December 2023 I had solved every problem I had in December 2022. I have people I love, friends I care about,
        and respect from others. For example, in December I went on a memorable party for the 18th birthday of the boy I
        mentioned in December 2022 who has transformed my life. I have mastered my productivity and discipline, despite
        there being some flaws, but I'm complaining on a rather high level. Now I know, life is a constant battle. 2023
        is a year lived without regret because I know that I genuinely tried hard in everything I did. I'm grateful for
        how much I improved. I have developed a lot as a person, in terms of skills, mind, body, and character. I've
        subtracted traumas and bad habits. I spend my time well, with work that brings me joy, reading, meditation,
        walks, and the gym. I've come closer to God. I saw what spiritual enlightenment meant. When my mother gets
        overly emotional, I simply take her in the arms as if she were a baby. Every month was one where I thought I
        would run out of things to write, yet each month was more interesting than the other one. I've learned a lot and
        experienced an abundance, I've gotten enough wisdom to collect well over 750 pages - and you must know that I
        started in June, halfway through the year. There were many moments, including this one, where I just think of
        how great my life is and how grateful I must be, while not seeing what I'm actually typing because my vision
        gets blurry with all the tears. There were many moments as such in 2023 and even more in 2024. I don't know what
        is going to be, yet I know that God is in control and that there is no way back. I didn't get anything for
        Christmas, yet I think a year like this is far better than any materialism. I wish everyone would write a
        reflection at the end of their year, this is something I can imagine doing for the rest of my life. When short
        2023 lasted from December 2022 to September 2023, I'm ready for long 2024 as a new chapter of my life, which I'm
        currently already in. 2023 has a round end, almost everything makes sense and everything went the way it was
        supposed to go when viewed from the larger perspective. For example, remember the birthday party I've been
        invited to that didn't take place? I've prepared a gift for her and it laid around in my room doing nothing, yet
        because she told me that she would give me a present for Christmas, I knew that it was the opportunity to allow
        destiny to reach its natural flow and today I will meet with newly gained friends to talk about life. </p>

    <p>I'm confident that 2023 was the year where I lived right.</p>

    <p>I thank all of you. I am grateful for the life I have.</p>

    <p>And… Recently, I've gained back my drive to do, and I was able to restore my discipline on the 30th of December.
        So, in the final moment, destiny took a turn in the right direction. May I now let go, accept, and come to
        peace.</p>
