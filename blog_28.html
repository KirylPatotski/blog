    <h1>People to stay away from</h1>

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

    <p>What’s the purpose of art? To elevate the soul. This philosophy of artistic expression resonates across music,
        architecture, and literature. Each artist conveys their genius differently, and each work captures insights of
        the zeitgeist. “David” is a marble statue by Michelangelo. It depicts shepherd David before his legendary fight
        with Goliath, years before he became king of the Israelites. It presents a prime example of uplifting and
        purposeful art. It speaks without words, inspiring growth in the viewer. Timeless art elevates.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, most of the population has zero interest in uplifting anyone. </p>

    <p><strong>Stay away from them</strong></p>

    <p>Please understand. Most know their problems and do nothing about them. They are aware of their issues but choose
        not to address them. Some even deny that their flaws are problematic in the first place. Most people are not
        deserving of much. </p>

    <p>Everyone is familiar with red flags such as lies, manipulation, abuse, or violence. However, those people's red
        flags become apparent quickly. I will guide you in recognizing other red flags you must be vigilant about. By
        raising standards, you can protect yourself and your relationships.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Life is abundant with opportunities.</em></strong> While it's true that everyone starts from a
        different point, the potential is abundant. If you consistently show up, are respectful, punctual, diligent,
        continue to learn, and demonstrate perseverance, it’s impossible to fail in the long run. Hard work, exercise,
        social connections, healthy eating, reading, and learning are always the right choices. Those who refuse to make
        these choices and don’t give their best are not the ones you should seek inspiration from. Those who waste their
        potential are not uplifting people.</p>

    <p><strong><em>The negative one.</em></strong> Instead of giving their best, some people complain — even better if
        they complain about things they have zero control over, such as the weather. They make excuses. If someone says,
        “I can’t do sports on a full stomach,” I lose respect for them. I recommend you surround yourself with people
        who don’t have these kinds of worries. Join people who express gratitude and discipline. Find people with a
        desire to attain mastery in life. </p>

    <p><strong><em>The ones who drag you down.</em></strong> Some people are negative because they like the depressive
        and dark. Others drag down purposefully. They will instill doubt and fear. “Who’s supposed to read texts written
        by a 16-year-old?” instead of “Because you started to write with 16, you will have an edge over everyone.”
        Negativity and dragging others down are the opposite of being uplifted. I don’t need their energy in my life. I
        say no to that. I want the kind of energy that Michelangelo’s David expresses.</p>

    <p><strong><em>They are not your friends.</em></strong> Look at any crowd. Everyone has their own story to tell.
        Everyone carries a piece of information only they know of. Everyone has specific traits and a specific skill
        set. That's beautiful. - How can it be that if I meet new people, most don't even ask who I am? How can some
        people go through life with closed eyes and disinterested? One conversation can change your life forever, and
        they aren't interested. Most friendships are limited to discussing the weather. How can you be friends with
        someone and not know their story?</p>

    <p>I don’t want you to become elitist and detached; you can still enjoy chatting for three minutes occasionally.
        Yet, I would not be friends with most people and recommend you do the same, because being with people who don’t
        want your best is spiritually very draining.</p>

    <p><strong>Can people change?</strong></p>

    <p>I’m going to ask you, did you change? No story of a living soul is finished writing. Powerful events can provide
        turning points. – Hence, most never change. The question remains: who gets a second chance, and who doesn’t? I
        don’t know, the choice is yours.</p>

    <p><strong>Trying to save people</strong></p>

    <p>You may feel the moral obligation to uplift people. Elevating souls yields fulfillment. Unfortunately, most don’t
        want your help. They are content to be where they are, and often, it’s their fault. I know many at the very
        bottom who have wealthy parents. If they wanted to improve, they would. They could decide to download a book
        online over playing video games. They could choose to start making the right choices. Life is incredibly giving.
        Savior complex can be overcome once you realize most people won’t ever be better. </p>

    <p>Trying to save and uplift people rarely works. Yet, I’m an exception. Someone saved me. I used to have many toxic
        traits, such as cold, judgmental, and arrogant. I had no social skills or friends and made many stupid mistakes.
        If it was not for him, I may never have gotten social.</p>

    <p><em>“At the beginning of 11th grade and the years prior, I didn't talk to anyone. I had many unresolved problems,
            so I didn't bother. I thought I had to work on myself first, and only then would I be allowed to improve my
            interpersonal skills; I was tempted by the work on my projects and considered never doing anything outside
            of it. At that point, I still had multiple deep traumas; I wasn't ready to open up. Yet, you were different.
            You never judged anyone and listened with enthusiasm. As a result, you were the first person I started
            talking to regularly, and I felt your passion, presence, and warmth. If it hadn't been for you, my life
            would have turned out differently, perhaps for the worse, as I might not have been able to recover if the
            changes came later. Not only did you help me break free from the deep fear I had of others, but you made it
            possible in the first place. You see, becoming social has helped me to remove past pain, all thanks to you.”
        </em> – letter I wrote him for his birthday, months after the initial publication of this text. </p>

    <p>Trying to fix people rarely works. Surrounding yourself with people at the bottom usually drags you down. But
        still, sometimes, one push in the right direction is all they need. Sometimes, life defeats insurmountable odds.
        Life never gets boring. The question is, should you take this risk? </p>

    <p><strong>On trustworthiness</strong></p>

    <p>Trust is the foundation of any mutual interaction. Without trust, nothing is possible. So, it's necessary for you
        to identify the people you can trust.</p>

    <p>Some have no opinion and believe exactly what they are being told. They distance themselves from the truth in
        fear of repercussions. They succumb to external manipulation and pressure quickly. They’re shells, and shells
        tend to break. How are you supposed to judge them if you know nothing about them - are they dangerous or not?
        They don’t trust you. Why trust them? </p>

    <p>People who argue against their will are untrustworthy. Any person who seriously defends the idea social media
        teaches something has their addiction speaking for them. Why trust people controlled by demons? Even if I may
        not like their ideas, I trust people with a free spirit.</p>

    <p>I would also argue that weak people are untrustworthy. People who succumb to addictions have much bigger
        problems. I’ve seen exceptions to that, but at least ten times as much evidence. Sometimes, weak people don’t
        even mean to be untrustworthy. Their circumstances often leave betrayal as the only choice. Weakness can be
        found anywhere. Some influential people don’t dare to stick up for the truth; they are weak and sell their
        souls. </p>

    <p>How can you figure this out quickly? - Be yourself. Trust attracts trust. Be authentic, and see how people react.
    </p>

    <p>If you fear being authentic will bring repercussions, you need new friends. A relationship where you play someone
        else is worse than useless because you practice being fake —untrustworthy. I also want to teach you something.
        I’m authentic; everyone knows I don’t filter myself, and that’s what people appreciate me for. Most likely, your
        authenticity will not have repercussions but admiration.</p>

    <p><strong>On saying the no</strong></p>

    <p>Why is “no” the most powerful word and “I had enough” the most potent phrase?</p>

    <p>Mere days ago, I got to know a 19-year-old in Spain who was the most submissive person I have ever seen. I could
        tell him anything, and he would say, “Yeah, you are correct,” and be too weak to stand up for himself. He could
        not say no to his mother, who dragged him down and made him a mommy-son. He was unable to say no to his phone
        addiction. He couldn’t start to pen his story; he kept saying yes to everything and no to himself.</p>

    <p>In 6th grade, we went on a school trip. There was a board game. Back then, board games were a thing. This board
        game consisted of fields with resources, and the purpose was to expand an empire. Initially, everyone gets
        placed in two villages to obtain further resources. Sane people pick the fields with the highest recourses. He
        knowingly chose the worst options. He is no threat to anyone. He is irrelevant. He doesn’t dare to say no.</p>

    <p>Say no to people who don’t want the best for you. Say no to something that goes beyond your boundaries. By saying
        no, you are saying yes to yourself. The biggest regret of dying is a life lived inauthentically—a life where
        people said yes to others and no to themselves.</p>

    <p>“I had enough” is the most potent phrase. </p>

    <p>In August 2022, I wasn't able to do ten pushups. I had enough. I did 150 per day until I started going to the
        gym. In July 2023, I had had enough of stuttering. Then, I began speaking in front of the camera daily, and
        after two weeks, I halved my stutters. </p>

    <p>“I have had enough” can start fundamental change; every literal and metaphorical revolution started with someone
        saying no.</p>

    <p><em>Everything you interact with shapes your reality. Life is an energy exchange. Dare to say no to people who
            don’t uplift. You don’t need negative energy. You don’t need people dragging you down. </em></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>High standards prevent nasty experiences.</em></p>
