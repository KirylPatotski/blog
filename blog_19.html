    <meta name="description"     content="The text explores the connection between productivity, bad habits, and pressure. It emphasizes that being productive doesn't guarantee progress, and eliminating bad habits doesn't automatically lead to happiness or productivity. The presence of meaningful tasks and appropriate pressure is crucial for productivity, while bad habits can impede progress.">

    <h1>Burnout</h1>

    <p>You don't need to know any productivity advice. You already know, that you must wake up at 5 am, you must take
        cold showers, you must forget about sugar, you must meditate regularly, you must …</p>

    <p>For 3 months straight I have been living in accordance with this idea of having your life in perfect order. I
        have had no bad habits anymore, no distractions, and nothing external was holding me back. Therefore, my
        productivity should be immense, right? Not so fast.</p>

    <p>I have noticed a significant difference between being productive with bad habits, being productive without bad
        habits, and being unproductive without bad habits!</p>

    <p>If you have bad habits, you can still be productive under enough pressure, even if that pressure comes from
        within. For example, as I started to learn how to program, I still had immense screen time on my phone, didn't
        do sports, and didn't get up at 5 am, still, I was able to focus and my work yielded big results. But, as I got
        rid of all my bad habits, and gained more expertise in my tasks, my productivity grew by a factor of at least
        10. Only as I had enough inner pressure and enough health, because I got rid of all my bad habits, I was able to
        outwork everyone, because all of the positive improvements compounded and made everything much better. My
        productivity reached such a level, enabling me to write a 25-page homework assignment in just 2 days or record 3
        YouTube videos in 1 day, or simply brainstorm 58 YouTube video ideas within 1 day. This time period was the
        happiest time of my life. </p>


    <p>But then, invisible to everyone, something started to happen at the end of May 2023. Having such immense
        productivity, lifestyle changes, such as getting up at 5 am even on weekends, as well as a growth in my skillset
        combined with ChatGPT, and strict deadlines, around 50 failures accumulated, from the last 2.5 years. At that
        time, I wasn't able to handle it, emotionally I noticed a fast decline. If you had asked me at the beginning of
        June how I felt, I would have explained that I didn't see significant progress in the last few days, and only
        progress matters, therefore I thought, that this development is simply temporary. The 50 failures alone wouldn't
        have been enough alone, to cause a burnout lasting 1 month, but rather 3 realizations, which I will explain
        later.</p>

    <p>In the middle of June 2023, I thought, that my burnout ended because I saw enormous productivity again. As you
        can see, I started to create these blogs at that time, and my diary entries looked like straight out of a
        motivational story, again. But, the following 2 weeks were completely unproductive again, I will explain in a
        few months why.</p>


    <p>The first realization I needed to make is that being productive doesn't mean you make progress. If let's look at
        my diary, from May: I was mostly busy with programming and YouTube. The things I coded were meaningful, but
        after I coded all the meaningful things, I noticed, that I simply faked being productive, by making complicated
        improvements to my apps, that were not even visible to outsiders or offered no meaningful improvement. This
        principle does not only apply to individuals, instead, you can see that in the entirety of the modern world. An
        example of this productivity faking is YouTube. What did they remove from the feature, which lets the user sort
        the videos by oldest or least popular? To get the feeling of productivity and progress. If you focus on small
        things, you can fake being productive, or at least the things you've accomplished will have no impact. </p>


    <p>Getting rid of bad habits doesn't mean more happiness or progress necessarily. Let's suppose that you get up at 5
        am and have no real tasks to do because you have learned your lesson of productivity faking. Now what? Will you
        stop getting up at 5 am and start with bad habits again, until you found the right thing to work on? No, you are
        above that level, in which case, realistically, you will simply do nothing, meaning you will get less
        “productive” than a person with bad habits and a lot of pressure.
        In fact, it's the pressure and combined with meaningful tasks, that create immense productivity, which gets
        amplified by good habits and skills. Therefore, it's possible, that you have no bad habits and are still
        unproductive because the pressure is missing or you are not focused on the most important tasks.
    </p>

    <p>But you shouldn't think that bad habits are good in any way, because it's better to be unproductive with no bad
        habits rather than having lots of bad habits and trying hard to be productive. Also, if you remove any bad
        habits and become unproductive, you are not damaging your health, rather, you are simply regenerating. </p>
