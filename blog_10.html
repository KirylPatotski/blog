    <p>Don't stop watching YouTube or reading</p>

    <p>
        In April 2023 I completely stopped to watch YouTube, because I have watched a lot of documentaries, tutorials,
        and scientific content prior to this and gained a lot of knowledge. Also, some things changed in my life, I
        started working out every day back in February, programmed a lot, and started to create YouTube videos myself.
    </p>

    <p>My creativity was so immense that I could simply come up with 100 ideas for anything, for example on 3rd May
        2023 I got 58 ideas for future videos. On the same day, I got ~30 ideas on how to improve my apps. At this time,
        I was constantly reading and learning. But now, it's June 11, 2023, and I have not been watching YouTube for 2
        full months and have not read anything for 2 weeks. What do you think happened to my creativity? I removed every
        distraction and focused on content creation and programming, and my creativity didn't increase, but instead, it
        slowly decreased.</p>

    <p>Obviously, you need to remove any distractions and bad habits and live in the current moment, sacrificing for
        later. But don't forget to keep learning and to keep consuming content, otherwise the same thing is going to
        happen to you.</p>
