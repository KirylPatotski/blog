    <h1>Living a thousand lives</h1>

    <p>One summer day in my childhood left a memory I will never forget. I was eleven years old, and my sister,
        grandmother, and I went to Rhodes, the southeasternmost Greek island, precisely two thousand kilometers from my
        home.</p>

    <p>That day, we got up in the middle of the night and drove to the airport. Our plane departed at five in the
        morning. I saw the sunrise on the plane and photographed it with my phone. After we flew for a few hours, we
        arrived in Rhodes, and then we took the bus to get to our hotel and checked in; after a while, we entered our
        room, and I asked for time because the day felt very long. <em>“It's just 16 o'clock.”</em></p>

    <p>Five years later, I remember very little from that vacation. I remember the island's magnificent tour, how we
        strolled through Rhodes Castle and tasted olive oils on a stop with a serene blue sky and lush forests, and how
        I ate watermelons all day because there wasn’t any water at the five-star hotel. I also remember the deep
        annoyance I felt from the singing cicadas. Outside of that, I remember nothing. </p>

    <p>You see, lying in the sun may be healthy, but it doesn’t create any memories. Hence, it doesn’t matter. An
        eventless life passes without you even noticing. It flies by quietly like the clouds in the sky. </p>

    <p>Masters of life manage to live thousands of lives in their short years. What do they know that you don’t? If you
        fill your life with action, you get to live longer. You can live more seconds if you never waste a second by
        constantly going above and beyond. Novelty creates a beautiful life.</p>

    <p>As you get older, you naturally start to slow down and relax. Knowing they have achieved everything, sitting down
        in the sunny garden is a true pleasure. But why not go as far as your feet can carry you?</p>

    <p>It’s the outstanding moments that matter.</p>
