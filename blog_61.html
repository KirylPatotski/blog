    <h1>Long life</h1>

    <p>One summer day in 2019, before I got started with my real journey and was just 11 years old, my sister,
        grandmother, and I went to <a href="blog_49.html">Rhodes</a> for the first time. I didn't want to go there, because of my general dislike
        of vacations, even at that point when I had no real purpose, nonetheless, no one asked. <a href="blog_49.html">Rhodes</a> is a Greek
        island, a special one because this island is the most south-east island which is considered to be a part of
        Europe instead of Asia and it's exactly 2000 kilometers away from Dresden. On that day we got up in the middle
        of the night and drove to the airport, our plane departed at 5 in the morning, and I saw the sunrise in the
        plane and photographed it with my 2012 phone. After we flew for a few hours we arrived in <a href="blog_49.html">Rhodes</a>, and then we
        took the bus to get to our hotel and checked in, after a while we entered our room and someone asked for time.
        <em>“It's just 16 o'clock”</em>
    </p>

    <p>I don't think I predicted this sentence to hardwire into my psyche forever, as this sentence would normally be
        considered “noise” and I thought that noise gets removed in your memories and only the things that matter will
        stay - as it turns out, in my memory, this sentence had as much weight as the beautiful trip around the island.
        Although I would have said something more like “It's just 18 o'clock” after the island tour, ignoring that I
        neither used nor owned a watch at that time. The message of both events tells the same thing. It's that eventful
        days that seem to last longer in person and create a large weight in your memory forever. </p>

    <p>In November of 2022, I started to go to a speech therapist and in March the therapy ended because the therapist
        moved away. At that point, I was curious, and I asked, when was the first session. “The first session was in
        November” “Oh, that's so long ago” “Well, for you it's long ago because you are 15. As you get older, time
        speeds up, for me 6 months are almost nothing.”</p>

    <p>I think, if I collect more of these essays, I could write a book full of these life lessons. This is without a
        doubt a very powerful one because it applies to you too.</p>

    <p>As long as you are young, many of the things you do, are being done for the first time and smaller time intervals
        take up bigger percentages of your life overall. If you do something for the time, you are creating new
        memories, so the key to living a long life is to try out new things constantly. Like this, your life will feel
        long because you will have a lot of different valuable memories. But you already knew it all along. </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Now it almost sounds as if I said everything there was to say. I think that this way of life is the only correct
        one, otherwise, you'll waste it and there is nothing worse than regret, because there is no way to reverse
        errors from the past, especially if it's too late.</p>

    <p>Constantly living in a state of novelty makes life worth living and interesting in the first place. There is no
        point in pursuing a life with nothing interesting in it because nothing extraordinary comes from the ordinary.
        Novelty doesn't mean that you should lose focus, but you still can go to the side while looking at your goal. As
        soon as you stop wasting your time and consequently your life, the novelty will come automatically. </p>

    <p>Now, as you get older you naturally start to slow down and relax - but some people aren't made to live like that.
        Some people simply can't just sit in the garden in the sunshine knowing that they have achieved everything and
        simply being happy, because achievements are meaningless after they are done, and only your daily life matters
        so, why not go as far as your feet can carry you instead of sitting down?</p>
