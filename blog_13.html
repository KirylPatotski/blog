    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Rest your baseline, update your music taste and learn how to sacrifice</span></h1>
    <h1>Stop listening to music, temporarily</h1>

    <p>In order to improve your music taste, or go gain a new perspective, challenge yourself to cut out music for a
        month. To clarify, see it as a challenge and not a permanent change. </p>

    <p>As you might expect, music is a pleasure and as with any pleasure, the more often you do it, the faster the fun
        runs out, and listening to music becomes no longer fun, but instead a necessity to function properly. To avoid
        this, you can set yourself a one-month challenge to stop listening to music. But there are also other reasons
        for you to cut out music.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>If you always listen to music while working, which you should, it may still not be optional because you
            may listen to the wrong kind of music. You should never listen to Hip Hop, or Rap for example, because they
            are too distractive. The reason for the distractive nature of this is that these songs are more interesting
            to listen to than perhaps programming a new screen. To reset your baseline, and move towards better music,
            sacrifice this month.</li>
        <li>Try out new things alternative to music. Perhaps you started listening to music a long while ago, in that
            case, a pause will be a rewarding experience. It may also change your music taste and move it potentially
            towards objectively better music, better than Hip Hop or Rap. Also, then when you start listening to music
            again, you will experience a lot more pleasure while doing so for a decently prolonged time.</li>

        <li>Without music everything will seem more boring and monotone, but that is fantastic because it removes
            pressure caused by the expectation that work doesn't have to be dull and boring. Instead, you can break free
            from these expectations and discover new joy in smaller things, even in dull and hard work.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The most important reason for you to sacrifice listening to music is something you may find surprising. Let's
        say, you are an ambitious young man or woman and working hard on yourself.</p>

    <ol start="4">
        <li>Show to yourself or to God, your willingness to sacrifice pleasure for the long term and your willingness
            to experience the world in its form without extra pleasure in the form of music. In your life, you will need
            to make a lot of sacrifices, and most of them are going to be much bigger than no music for 30 or 31 days.
            This is an opportunity to practice your determination and willpower.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That means, if you stop listening to music for a month, you will renew your music taste, potentially to a better
        one, you will experience a new perspective, you will start to enjoy music more in the long run, and the biggest
        benefit is the knowledge, that no sacrifice is too big for you.</p>
