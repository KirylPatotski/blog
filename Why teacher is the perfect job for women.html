 <h1>Why teacher is the perfect job for women</h1>

  <p>Firstly, why can I speak on that topic? My mother is a teacher. Also, I don’t know if you noticed it or not, but
    teaching is what I like to do and exactly what I'm doing right now. Hence, I know what I'm talking about. Here are
    the reasons why teaching is a great job for women.</p>

  <p><em><strong>(1) You control how much weight you add to it.</strong></em> Weight combines stress, time, emotions,
    and other things. Some teachers are not very active while others voluntarily take on many responsibilities. As a
    teacher, you can become as important as you want in your school or even across schools. It is also possible to go
    part-time and prioritize family. Work-life balance is important for mothers. The power to vary weight considers that
    priorities may shift over the decades to come, which is especially relevant for you as an aspiring mother of many
    beautiful children. </p>

  <p><em><strong>(2) Teachers aren’t stressed, many are relaxed.</strong></em> Some teachers report being stressed,
    though that’s a misconception. (a) Everything is stressful at the beginning. (b) Competent teachers are not
    stressed. Some with an F in math who became a teacher might find it stressful, but they would find everything
    stressful anyway. (c) Beyond a certain point drama at school with some students becomes irrelevant and you learn to
    handle it. You also learn to establish yourself, that’s why the classes of older teachers are always quiet. If you
    are already the leader of your female friends, have excellent grades, and are pretty, you will not have to worry
    about stress as a teacher.</p>

  <p><em><strong>(3) Emotional balance.</strong></em> For instance, the literature teacher of my sister matches this
    profile. If your husband is very assertive, you can express your power-hungry side at work. </p>

  <p><em><strong>(4) A lot of evidence.</strong></em> The majority of teachers are women. They seem to do well. </p>

  <p><em><strong>(5) Teachers are abundant in free time.</strong></em> Most people like to relax. Virtually all women
    like to relax. Most people want a life with a family, job, garden, and maybe sports. Maybe I'm sexist, but I think
    women should not strive to be hyper-competent and live every second productively while optimizing every single thing
    about their lives. I can create 10 videos in a day, solve 10.000 mental math tasks in 11 hours to demonstrate the
    superiority of your apps, or write 8.000 words in a few hours. On the flip side, on vacations I become depressed and
    this is no sarcasm, I can’t handle lying in the sun, eating in an all-inclusive hotel and there’s nothing I hate
    more than just sitting on a boat. That’s my life and that’s what works for me. Not to be arrogant, but do not
    forget, you are not me. I work because I want nothing but success in life while most work to get time to relax. Most
    men and practically every woman on earth couldn’t handle my lifestyle and would suffer pointless pain if they tried
    to endure it. What should a future mother get up at three in the morning for? Stress is only healthy for a very
    certain caliber of person, for everyone else, stress is crippling. If you truly wanted an extraordinary and
    ambitious life, you would be living it already. In that sense, free time is a nice thing for you and women in
    general, and you should be authentic with your desires. </p>

  <p><em><strong>(6) Teachers are hotter than doctors.</strong></em> Teachers are around children. The whole point of a
    teacher is to help children grow up. Do you see how that’s helpful? Your sexual market value increases, which means,
    you become more attractive as a teacher than as an ‘ambitious woman’ who wants to become a doctor or something
    similar. Many men, including myself, find high ambition in women repelling because it undermines fundamental
    principles. Long term, if the woman brings more cash, has higher status, and works longer hours than the man, the
    relationships tend to be unhappy. You might think that that’s irrelevant in the 21st century and that gender roles
    can be inversed, but that just does not work in almost every case. Now you may be thinking that you can just take a
    man of even higher status, ambition, and money than yourself to counter the problem of the woman being high status
    and the man a beta. That can be possible, but not very likely because where is the complementary opposite and why
    should a man with immense status pick a girl who won’t be able to focus on family? Being a doctor as a woman
    drastically reduces your chances of a happy relationship, it makes you less attractive and compatible with far fewer
    options next to being stressful and exhausting as a job. If you choose a job like a doctor which will make you less
    attractive, it better be worth it! ----- Everyone with common sense above the age of 35 understands that this
    feminist doctrine of ‘women need to prioritize work over family’ is false. Frankly, women who believe this feminist
    stuff aren’t desired among men to begin with. Maybe I'm a bit biased here again, but I would argue women should only
    work for fun, provided they are attractive. Teaching is a job you can work ‘for fun’. Doctor not, that’s your entire
    life. Why do I think women should work for fun only? There’s no reason an attractive woman should work a job she
    doesn’t like except out of desperation, i.e. if the man doesn’t bring enough cash. Working a job you enjoy,
    increases your emotional well-being and health. You also gain more fulfillment and purpose in your life.
    Consequently, you become sexier. Your man will feel better as well and work harder. Working for fun as a woman
    drives a positive feedback loop. ----- Being a teacher increases your attractiveness. You are around children -
    motherly - and that’s what men look for. You are not too ambitious and hence don’t repel high-quality men. Instead,
    you spend time with children and relax to your liking, which makes teachers desirable.</p>

  <p><em><strong>(7) I promise you’ll love it.</strong></em> I promise you will be grateful for never having to work
    night shifts, never having to worry about death or life decisions and you will certainly appreciate standing in
    front of the class and the attention you’ll get. Teacher is also a well-respected job and respect equals status. Job
    security is high and salaries are above average, at least in Germany. Schools are everywhere, schools are necessary.
    I assume you enjoy studying yourself. I’m convinced schools have a better atmosphere than a sterile hospital with a
    piercing smell and the omnipresence of pain, schools are for children after all. Teaching, explaining, and
    correcting can easily bring one into a flow. I’m convinced it’s satisfying and interesting to watch your students
    grow up and become decent – with your influence. Is it not heartwarming to make two young students secretly in love
    sit together ‘because the class is noisy’? Who knows, maybe some students you’ll teach will surpass everyone in
    their bloodline and establish your immortality as a great teacher.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Kiryl P., 30.5.2024</strong></em></p>

  <p><em>For German women.</em> What kind of teacher should you become, Grundschule (primary school), Oberschule (middle
    school) or Gymnasium (‘elite’ school)? The answer is simple. If you like young, loud, naïve children, choose primary
    school. If you don’t like children too much and don’t want to do anything intellectual, pick Oberschule. If you want
    to avoid drama, degenerate students, and stress, pick Gymnasium. Higher standards make life easier for all
    participants. The gymnasium is also great because it’s intellectually more challenging. Altogether - the Gymnasium.
