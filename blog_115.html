    <h1>What heartbreak feels like</h1>

    <p>What is a story for? The 'minus' is associated with negativity though it merely flips, reflects, and mirrors.
        Hence, a well-done story calms the disturbed and disturbs the calm by reflecting.</p>

    <p>May the story start now.</p>

    <p><em>No time - timeless, no place - everywhere, no one - everyone. I'm clueless about what the future will bring,
            I'm clueless about what I will bring to the future and I'm even more clueless about what will become of us
            all. Dear heavens, how do I express?</em></p>

    <p><em><strong>No one - everyone could have said that.</strong></em> “You will always recover. Look into the future
        and think ahead! Now it may seem as if you will never be able to stand up, but eventually, you will. Accept. Do
        not try to rush, things take their time.” </p>

    <p>People who lost a loved one are always told that they will recover just fine. Yet, I doubt this statement's
        correctness. I know precisely what the loss of a loved one feels, perhaps I know it too well. The loved one is a
        metaphor, one for death, rejection, or the completion of a lifelong dream. They all feel the same, though with
        different names. </p>

    <p>Initially, it feels easy. For the first few moments, nothing changes, as one is probably mentally offline anyway,
        completely detached from the reality that truly matters, instead sunk in a fake one, where one is just a cog in
        a machine, stripped of all humanity by exploitative repetition. You are in a state of the name and not of
        reality. Work, school, chores - they all have names, yet reality does not, since there's just one, and you find
        yourself submerged in an alternative, one full of patterns. Nothing changes. One continues to live in the world
        of concepts. But this does not last long, as soon as one thinks a conscious thought, he leaves the world of
        patterns and wakes up to the deeper levels of reality, one breathes in, and suddenly everything collapses,
        everything you did or worried about seems insignificant. You felt a cold shiver down the spine and now you are
        fully awake. </p>

    <p>It's counterintuitive, but you get the sensation of freedom, nothing matters anymore and you are awake, still,
        your body thinks differently, and you can't hide shaky hands with tension in your face. Usually, one is worried
        about someone and suddenly there is nothing to worry about. You know it's over and there is never going to be
        another possibility to experience their love. The bliss continues. There is some sense of letting go when you
        realize that this person is gone and there is nothing you can do about it. At least it's not your fault, you
        reason. You feel inner freedom not because this freedom brings liberty, but because it pokes a large hole in
        one's mind. A few more minutes pass and you feel completely alright. You will start to think that this scenario
        was much worse in your thoughts than it was in reality. </p>

    <p><em>“I thought I would grieve without end and now I seemingly moved on effortlessly. Don't know why some people
            grieve for years and why some are permanently depressed.” </em></p>

    <p>The hole gets bigger by the minute. You start to think of that message again. Maybe it was just a test, maybe it
        was exaggerated, maybe it was a false alarm. Maybe there is hope and something you can do. You start to reread
        that note, you start to check your phone again and you start to rethink the second horrible news hit you and it
        hit so hard that it ripped apart everything, just as a bullet that wrecks the window it flies through out of
        nowhere. No one saw it coming, and when it hit no one looked. It's only your window that's now in ruins. Then
        that inner emptiness becomes more persistent. You notice how five minutes passed without you thinking a single
        thought. Or maybe you don't notice anything anymore, though suddenly every sound seems to be dreadfully loud and
        you don't understand how your senses got sharp and your mind numb. In that moment you will feel and think
        nothing, and mistake this void for your newly gained freedom. Now that this person is gone, your mind will be
        able to think about other things, great, isn't it? - You gained 'mental real estate for productive thoughts'.
        Isn't thinking about nothing what mediation is trying to achieve, well, there you get it, for free, can you
        believe that? You couldn't believe how easy moving on is you can't understand why everyone is struggling with
        it… </p>

    <p>Then. After a few moments of trance, it hits you unpredictably. Now do I what? You cannot ask for help, a hug
        won't help either, the hole is just too great. No one cares as much as you do, no one will remember your grief
        except for you. You break out in tears and there is nothing you can do about it; you can't help but grieve. You
        may try to rationalize it away. You know that intelligence spears the world and solves problems, but spearing
        yourself kills you as a person, hence rationalizing does not help in these situations. It's tempting to think
        what one can do, and it brings precisely zero.</p>

    <p>You can't help but just fall on your bed without caring about the disorder in your room. Everything felt
        irrelevant in the first moments and now everything reached indifference. The jokes others tell aren't remotely
        amusing, you stop understanding why the hell you found them amusing in the first place! The work you are
        supposed to go to feels cold and ignorant. If you play sports, you instantly lose any desire, if you write you
        won't be able to combine five words. You will start to feel a strong sense of meaninglessness, that hole is
        still not filled and still gets bigger. It's not exactly that you feel sad, it's just that suddenly chocolate
        isn't sweet and you look at the clock and it's already four in the evening despite you just having woken up from
        your twelve-hour sleep. You feel as if time doesn't pass, instead it runs. It worries you, there will be nothing
        in your ability to stop. This helplessness doesn't make things better. The realization of forced passivity,
        where one is stripped of one's full consciousness makes one break out in tears. </p>

    <p>Those tears are what will help you to recover. Tears are better than feeling nothing than being unconscious. You
        remember that you've been indoctrinated with 'you will always recover' despite healing not seeming to approach.
        You remember that things take their time. Nature has a natural rhythm. Inevitably you run out of tears. That
        short bliss from a few days ago is long gone and you start to question whether you had in the first place and
        what you did just a few hours ago. Your consciousness is turned off, at least in large parts. It shuts down
        because consciousness's purpose is to solve problems evolution did not find an answer for. Yet, this is
        something almost every organism has to face, the cognition that one failed at life's most important tasks. Time
        dies and you notice that nothing is real. You look at the clock and it goes more than twice as fast. You look at
        the clock again and somehow another four hours passed with you having done absolutely nothing and not forming
        any new memories. Now you start to wonder: what is it that makes one human? </p>

    <p>No one - no, me; I can tell. Consciousness - and you've lost it and are now in liminality. You start to ask
        yourself whether there is such a thing as a life unworthy of living. What live for, if the difference to the
        lifeless is little in the absence of consciousness? If life flies by and you are unable to exert free will, you
        are just as dead as the water that flows downhill without its will. You are at nature's mercy. The only thing
        separating the dead and the living is the fight against the universe's inherent indifference, but what if one
        gives up fighting, what is left? </p>

    <p>But you refuse to give up. You've hit the bottom and you realize that you can only go up from here. Are there
        lives unworthy of being lived? Maybe. Is it yours? No. Why? Because you say so. Your free will commands the
        realization, that <em>you will always recover</em>. Because, if you were unconscious, you wouldn't be able to
        think
        thoughts and wouldn't be able to decide if there is such a thing as a life unworthy of living, you would just. -
        <em>You thought; therefore you are.</em>
    </p>

    <p>When you start to think, you gain awareness of what has just been, and as a result, you know that recovery comes
        closer. You gain hope. But it won't be easy.</p>

    <p>Your will got a little boost and you decide to use the momentum. You know that going for walks to see the sun
        helps - but you feel unable to, you can't understand how you've been able to walk for several hours on end just
        a week prior. Your will is not strong enough, you feel as if you want to be helpless. If you have large control
        over your mind i.e. if you used to have high levels of consciousness, you will be able to choose what to think
        and how to feel, yet you will desire to grieve. I will tell you from experience, grieve, things take time. In
        the next while the mourning returns and you start to question what you deserve this for and even less why you
        felt relief in the first moments and why after a trance you regained consciousness. You try to think about it
        again and nothing makes sense. </p>

    <p><em>How fancy! You start to appreciate the consciousness you've lost. What a unique lesson, starting to
            appreciate
            what one has lost and hopes to gain back! Some learn, others don't. </em>It depends purely on your habits
        and what
        you did at that time. Most numb themselves even further to kill the consciousness. Others do what they would do
        just as usual, just because you don't feel like doing pushups doesn't mean you can't do any. It is precisely
        this feeling of nothing that helps with recovery, feeling nothing makes hardship easier. You feel nothing in the
        first place because of hardship, but if one is smart, he can use this as an opportunity to establish greater
        discipline. It's a test. Some will try to numb themselves with inauthentic behavior, and addictions and surround
        themselves with losers. Others will use this to change and to develop. I've had both, the first path makes
        things a lot worse. The consciousness baseline of most people is too low for them to choose the second option,
        because they think to have nothing to gain, what does one need to restore consciousness, just to go back into a
        world of patterns? One does not need to be conscious of the world one will return to consists of exploitative
        repetition, so recovery is going to be almost impossible, i.e. their highest consciousness is as terrible as the
        lowest consciousness of a monk. So, it's a test of one's entire existence. Time is going to pass anyway; the
        choice is yours. </p>

    <p>Slowly, consciousness, gratitude, and the lust to do things return, chocolate starts to taste sweet again, the
        flowers smell good again and all of this seems to break apart as you reenter your depressive trance. You feel
        hopeless again. You want to take out your bike because you know that fresh and sunshine help, you take the
        strength to do so, and just as you go downstairs and want to take it out, you realize that it's tangled up with
        the other bikes, you try to grab your bike, shake it and nothing works, you collapse on the hard winter ground
        and lie there, looking at the sky. At least you have a strong desire to do so. Just to slow down. Why fight
        against the universe, it's impossible when consciousness disappears. You don't understand how you've been able
        to generate an immeasurable drive and discipline just a month ago. You feel even more hopeless - you cannot
        escape … Helplessness returns, just as the tears that wash one clear. Life goes on and you despise that cold
        indifference.</p>

    <p>You've been indoctrinated with the belief that you will always recover and soon delight again, despite it being
        hard. Slowly, after horrible days, weeks, months, or years you start to recover. It's not a linear process, but
        one of constant setbacks and countless hopeless moments.</p>

    <p>You look at the icon on your wall and have faith in God. The hug from others feels warm again, the flowers scent
        wonderfully and the sunset shows splendid colors. </p>

    <p>Slowly. Things take their time. </p>

    <p>You learn that recovery was an illusion, and now you're a different person, the wounds were too great to be
        healed, the emptiness not able to be filled entirely. The crater's borders merely erode and a new forest grows
        on top. You are never going to view a sunset the same way. Things have changed.</p>

    <p>I hope this will happen never, nowhere, and to no one again, yet it's inevitable. </p>

    <p>Life is defined as the fight against the universe's cold indifference, and soon you will get strong enough to
        continue fighting, there is something about life that gives it the ability to stand up, no matter how often it
        falls. Life goes on, the universe's cold indifference is liberating.</p>

    <p>Eventually, you will recover, no matter how unlikely it seems. Yet, don't expect the healing not leave behind
        scars or to be fast. Things take their time. Hence, I command, do not fear!</p>

    <p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br></p>

    <p>Handling the loss of a loved one is not easy, there are two options. The first option is to numb yourself, to
        kill the consciousness, and to let time pass even quicker. This is the option most people take and it does not
        work. Surely, it will make you recover a bit, but then the bad habits are going to become the problem and drag
        you down. That's how some people end up with mild lifelong depression. You are going to despise yourself. If you
        numb yourself badly and long enough, recovery may become practically impossible. So, parties, promiscuity, dying
        hair (I dare you to observe it yourself!), loser friends, internet usage, shopping or eating sugar don't work -
        rather, they make things worse. They only work if enough time passes and you stop with those things naturally,
        but unfortunately, that's rare, for example, internet addiction does not go away on its own, it drags one down
        forever unless fought actively against. It would only go away naturally if you started those things only when
        feeling down, such as eating chocolate for heartbreak and then finding someone new and getting healthy again.
        Frankly, almost everyone had a bunch of bad habits and they 'recover' just fine. But I have observed that their
        'recovery' is like my worst state, as the average person has almost no consciousness. So, use this path if you
        aren't extremely conscious to begin with and don't desire to change that. I know many people who are content
        having read zero books last year. But those people don't know how high the human experience can get and that's a
        pity.
    </p>

    <p>I tried this approach of numbing myself around Christmas 2023 and it was so terrible that I still did not recover
        fully, I had to use the second method afterward.</p>

    <p>The second path is something for the superior kind of person. It's as simple as lying in bed, meditating all day
        long, and pushing even harder on discipline. Lie in bed as if you are sick for as long as necessary, although I
        promise it's not going to be longer than three days. After lying in bed and staring at the ceiling for days,
        push harder on activities that restore consciousness, for example, intense sports, intense rejection of earthly
        pleasure (discipline), reading, and prayer. Remember what God is for? For hope and faith, you'll need both.
        Trust in God and things shall go your way, why do you think religion has such great effects on the mind? The
        cold is excellent at restoring consciousness. Another powerful tip is to explore all day long, go on a trip for
        example to occupy yourself and to make your consciousness necessary because of the new impressions. Also,
        remember that you aren't alone. (In my case talking about heartbreak did not work, because everyone told me how
        sweet that is that I love this girl and encouraged me to fight and explained how desirable she is and that my
        concerns are pointless…) Remember that everyone has to go through it and remember the person with the last
        laugh. </p>

    <p>If you grieve over the death of someone, things are a bit more difficult, because there is little you can do
        about it, I'm not qualified to talk about that. </p>

    <p>There is also another kind of depression you may encounter and it has a romantic name, post-success depression.
        If you work years on a goal and give everything to make your vision materialize, you will break shortly after
        you achieve your goal and go through the same process that strongly resembles heartbreak. There is only one way
        to avoid this kind of suffering, be free of ambition and just do what brings you in the flow. <br><br>Love others more
        than your goals. </p>

    <p>That's how you find consciousness after it's gone.</p>
