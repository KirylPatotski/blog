    <h1>Uncertainty</h1>

    <p>On Friday of the last summer holiday week, I went to a little business competition in Dresden, which is 2 hours
        away by train from where I live. After the event ended, I walked to the train station even though I didn't look
        at the schedule - there is a train once every 2 hours. I simply went into the train station and 15 minutes later
        the train arrived on its own. My mother asked me when the train was scheduled to arrive in my hometown and I
        said I didn't know and I didn't care - a schedule won't dictate my life. I didn't look at the schedule, so how
        could I know? On the train itself, I completed high-leverage work, creating an <a href="blog_50.html">ad</a>
        campaign, after
        procrastinating for 6 months with it. My mother looked at the schedule worrying about me and she went to the
        train station to wait for my train - and waited a long time there. Turns out the train arrived 30 minutes too
        late and I didn't care or notice because I worked. <br><small>Friday, 18.8.2023</small></p>


    <li>Make the best out of any situation and do as you desire. Live with absolute inner security and lay back. </li>

    <p>In Russian class in school, the teacher gave us a worksheet that we had to complete and she explained in parallel
        our task for next Friday, which is to give a little presentation about our summer holidays with a targeted
        duration of 5-10 minutes. She told us we would complete this worksheet this lesson and next Thursday we would
        draft our presentations and finally present them next Friday. I instantly raised my hand, asking if I could give
        the presentation right now. I wanted to skip all that useless nervousness and doubt and simply do something. She
        responded that I should complete my worksheet first and then see if I still desired to present. I completed the
        worksheet, gave the presentation without notes or without ever speaking it through, and nailed it. 15/15.

    <li>There would have been no point in waiting, as this would cause useless stress. However, as you might notice,
        it takes hard and soft skills to get there in the first place. Competence comes first.</li>

    <p>On the day of the same train ride, I went on this little business pitch competition and lecture which lasted 2
        days and this Friday was the 2nd day. Before the presentations started, I went on stage and waited there
        visualizing myself winning and showing how desiring and ready I am. I gave the first presentation and got the
        first place. After all, you shouldn't get too emotional, since you aren't a little girl, be calm instead and
        fight. <br><small>Friday, 18.8.2023</small></p>

    <li>Fear is holding you back.</li>

    <p>Today I was resting a little bit, (my kind of resting, though) and I decided to go to a little ruin somewhere in
        the mountains. I knew the ruin's approximate location and that was enough. As I had been walking for a solid 2.5
        hours, I finally found it. Altogether I walked 21 km, for 4 hours. I didn't exactly know or care where the ruin
        was located because I knew that this would cause useless stress. I would need to worry about going on the right
        path constantly if I relied on technology to find the right path. (Although until the summer of 2023, this ruin
        didn't even show on Google Maps) Instead, I enjoyed the path more than the destination - Eventually, I still
        found the ruin hidden in a mountain's top covered in trees.

    <li>Success is striving towards a worthy ideal. Enjoy the path more than the destination and discover more when
        you don't look at the results. </li>

    <p>In May 2023, my family and I went on a little trip to <a href="blog_4.html">Vienna</a>. At that time, I had
        already been creating YouTube
        cinematic videos and time-lapses for already 2 years, so naturally, I took my camera gear with me. On the other
        hand, quite literally the other hand, I took no food or drink with me. We had breakfast in the hotel every day.
        That means we went on trips from 9 - 18 o'clock every day and I was without food or water at that time, and we
        also didn't have dinner either. Again, I didn't care and things reality turned me a favor again - there were
        water dispensers spread throughout Vienna, and I encountered them - just as the arrived train after a 15-minute
        wait.</p>

    <li>Think about yourself last and stay resourceful. This point is especially done by my mother, who waited at the
        train station. You don't know what's going to happen even if you have competence and confidence, so stay
        resourceful.</li>

    <p>Altogether, every story tells something unique about flexibility, adaptability, confidence, competence, fearlessness,
        presence, making the best out of any situation, and enjoyment of the little and uncertain things, however, all these
        facets have something in common. They embrace life's uncertainty and value it. Although these principles overlap
        with <a href="blog_12.html">discipline</a>, <a href="blog_6.html">regret minimization</a>, and <a
            href="blog_62.html">speed</a>. Uncertainty brings a seed of success. Life consists of order
        and chaos, and this approach is handling chaos with order. </p>

    <p>It will take a few years of living this way until you realize that worrying, living by someone else's rules,
        hesitating and overthinking was an illusion all along. This method will help you to enjoy every <em>micro-moment</em>
        of your life. Use this strategy if you don't need to think long term, use it to live in the present moment.</p>
