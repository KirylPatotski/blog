  <h1>Welcome to Helimath!</h1>
  <p>Are you ready to unlock the power of mental math and improve your memory capabilities? Helimath is here to help you
    achieve your goals and make your life easier through enhanced cognitive abilities.</p>

  <h1>Benefits of Mental Math</h1>
  <p>Mental math skills offer numerous benefits that extend beyond calculations. Developing proficiency in mental math
    can positively impact various aspects of our lives.</p>
  <p>One significant benefit is that mental math enhances brain speed and sharpness. Regular mental calculations
    stimulate neural connections, leading to improved cognitive function. With practice, individuals can perform
    calculations swiftly and accurately, reducing reliance on calculators or written methods.</p>
  <p>In addition to improving brain speed, mental math cultivates focus. Engaging in mental calculations requires
    concentration and attention to detail, training our minds to stay present and focused on the task at hand.</p>
  <p>Mental math also plays a vital role in improving overall mental health. Studies have shown that engaging in
    mentally stimulating activities, such as mental math exercises, can help prevent cognitive decline and age-related
    memory problems. It provides a workout for the brain, keeping it active and healthy.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, training the brain through mental math exercises strengthens neural pathways associated with
    problem-solving and analytical thinking. This not only enhances mathematical abilities but also promotes critical
    thinking skills that can be applied to various real-life situations.</p>
  <p>Finally, one of the most significant advantages of mental math is that it makes our lives easier. By being
    proficient in mental calculations, we can quickly estimate quantities, calculate discounts or tips, and perform
    everyday calculations effortlessly. It eliminates the need to rely on external tools and allows us to tackle
    mathematical tasks efficiently.</p>

  <h1>Benefits of Short Term Memory</h1>
  <p>Short-term memory, or working memory, plays a crucial role in our ability to process and remember information in
    the present moment. Enhancing short-term memory skills can have several advantages in our daily lives.</p>
  <p>Firstly, a strong short-term memory makes it easier to remember information. Whether it's recalling phone numbers,
    addresses, or important dates, an improved short-term memory helps us retain and retrieve essential information more
    effectively.</p>
  <p>In the context of mental math, a good short-term memory is invaluable. It allows us to hold intermediate results
    and numbers in our minds while performing calculations, enabling faster and more accurate mental math computations.
  </p>
  <p>Short-term memory also contributes to an easier life. By enhancing this cognitive function, we can effortlessly
    memorize shopping lists, directions, or instructions, reducing the need for constant reference and improving
    efficiency in daily tasks.</p>
  <p>Moreover, a well-developed short-term memory positively affects mental performance. It enables better
    concentration, comprehension, and retention of new information, leading to improved learning outcomes in various
    domains.</p>
