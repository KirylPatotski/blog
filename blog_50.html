    <h1>Failures kill</h1>

    <p>If you know me in real life well enough, which currently only a very small amount of people do, you will know
        that I am entirely unpredictable. Unless this is the first text of mine that you are trying to understand by
        reading it, you may be a part of the few people in possession of this knowledge. </p>

    <p>Most people will tell that failures are a part of progress and to some extent, that is absolutely true. But not
        always. In fact, in June 2023 <em>I failed so hard</em>, around 50 failures accumulated, that it caused a month
        of
        reset. While other things contributed to my <a href="blog_19.html">burnout</a>, and not all of these 50 failures
        were big or important,
        some were - The failure that slapped me in the face the hardest, singlehandedly stopped my progress in this
        area, for 6 months. (Now you will see why I am completely unpredictable) Normally I never procrastinate, but
        here I have messed up so hard. </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Failures are not what they seem</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If I look at my achievements, like building a couple of apps or running 2 YouTube channels as well as a blog,
        these life-changing achievements seem minor in text. </p>

    <p>What do you need to learn to create an app? You need to learn how to code, design, build systems, manage content,
        plan, market, … and so on. Each of these sub-tasks include countless sub-tasks themselves. For example,
        programming consists of logic, math, architecture, syntax, automatization, data, and flow, to name a few. You
        have no clue what a task consists of, if you have never done it before. If
        you have no skills, everything you do will slap you in the face, if you start doing it professionally. You can
        try it yourself, by trying to build a website from scratch - I even failed, despite having 2.5 years of
        experience in this respective field. There are simply too many things you simply have no idea of, and at the
        beginning, you are not even aware of them.</p>

    <p>In order to learn you have to try relentlessly. Assuming you somehow woke up with everything you would need
        to know about all the things I just mentioned, you still will get slapped in the face. Everything comes at the
        right time, and therefore you wouldn't know how to improve further. How would you use the knowledge you
        acquired, if you still have a screen time of 2 hours and don't get up at 5? Why can't you imagine being a 10x
        performer? Because everything comes at the right time, and you are not ready for it. How is it that does
        everything come at the right time? Because everything you excute7 consists of such small changes and tasks, hidden
        beneath
        the surface of your existence. To create an app in 1 year, you need to work on it every day. How often do you
        think, do you need to resist giving up, how often do you need to resist resting or sinking in pleasure? That's
        where real progress derives from because your life consists of micro-moments leading to big things. If you can
        improve those micro moments, you'll be unstoppable.</p>

    <p>That means if you achieve something noticeable, for example, an app, you have shown to others and primarily to
        yourself, that you are capable of doing anything at all. The time you put in is gigantic, and even bigger are
        those micro-moments. Looked at the phone? Already a micro-moment wasted and momentum lost. That's exactly what
        this concept is about. How many wins and lifestyle changes you need to obtain to achieve anything are
        immeasurable. Let me put it this way: the battle is won before it starts, and the battle shows only the results
        of the preparation. This preparation phase is significantly more complicated and longer than the actual fight
        itself.</p>

    <p>Let's reverse this logic. If a win is the result of countless successful micro-decisions and micro-wins, which
        are in turn the result of your lifestyle, what do failures show? They show a missing foundation, countless
        micro-fails, and countless wrong decisions. If there are 50 fails at once, you have been doing a lot of wrong
        things and your failures are the result of so many wrong decisions. It's never a single wrong decision that
        kills, because otherwise all the thousands of small decisions will compensate for that. I couldn't handle what I
        have been doing wrong in June, which led to an emotional decline at first, and later I simply stopped being
        productive altogether - <em>failures kill</em>.</p>

    <ol start="2">
        <li>I failed so hard</li>
    </ol>

    <p>One of the failures that contributed to my burnout was easy to describe: "I wasted 50€ on a 2-week ad campaign."
        But, that means, I picked the wrong time, the wrong graphics, the wrong messages, my "brand" was wrong, my
        product was wrong at that time, I addressed the wrong people and I didn't pay attention. That's a failure on all
        fronts so to speak. To demonstrate how I failed on every front, here is a little example. </p>

    <p>I have search history disabled everywhere because I don't need to save useless information. But, if there are
        sites that I want to remember, I simply bookmark them. On the other hand, I use Google Chrome for all of my
        administrative work, such as YouTube, Google Play, and email, because I am signed in all the time. Now, I have
        monitored my campaign over 2 weeks in February 2023 and wondered why the report stuck on the first day of the
        campaign. As it turns out, my search history recommendation had the URL saved from the first day only. What a
        silly mistake. That's what I mean by failure on all fronts. If I saw the reports from the other days, I could
        have <em>adjusted</em> the course, instead my account got suspended for a while. </p>

    <p>I knew, of course, that failures are necessary in order to learn. But this failure was so large for me, that I
        had to adjust many things. It's better to be corrected than to be misled, in reality, that's different because
        reality will always show you the cruel truth, where you messed up. I build up a lot of fear as a result, even
        more than I had before of ad campaigns. </p>

    <p>In the description of this website, I have written something like "enjoy getting inspired". This story would not
        be inspiring if I didn't use its lessons to improve and to be reborn like a phoenix. This is a story on how I
        will try 4 different ad campaigns. </p>

    <ol start="3">
        <li>The execution</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For a long time, I have procrastinated with this task, of creating a new, adjusted, and improved ad campaign,
        even though it seems simple on the surface. I procrastinated for over 6 months; I could say without being
        entirely wrong. Reality is never that simple of course, I used this time to develop myself and my brand as well
        as my products, to avoid such a failure again, because it showed that I wasn't ready. But, before I failed the
        first time in February 2023 I did procrastinate for a very long time with this task, and that is because I was
        scared of what it might reveal, but you can't live in an illusion forever, because then the break from it
        becomes even harder.</p>

    <p>I knew, however, that pressure creates motivation and deadlines make hard tasks seem a lot easier, so when asked
        what my favorite YouTube video is, I would say it's the one where I explain deadlines. It's the end of the 6th,
        the last week of my summer holidays and I promised myself, that I will complete a new and solid as well as
        successful ad campaign this summer holidays. </p>

    <p>On Sunday of the last week, I went for a 2-hour walk, just as every other day since my <a
            href="blog_19.html">burnout</a>, even though I
        fully recovered from it now. I don't understand how I could live without walks before this, because even a
        2-hour walk every day and writing blogs is not enough to comprehend everything in my life. This time I took my
        notebook and walked for 6 kilometers until I sat down at a bench in late noon, almost in the evening, when the
        weather was absolutely perfect and sunny and free of wind. The bench was located at the western side of the lake
        I walk around almost every day at the exact times. I sat down, and had nothing distracting me, and wrote down
        what I have to present to my app users, meaning what could attract them - and made them into ideas for ads.
        Altogether I synthesized 6 ideas, for my 3 apps.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On Thursday, I created the first 4 ad videos and almost got started…</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Today is Friday, the 18th of August 2023 and I have 2 days left, until the summer holidays end. The last 6 weeks
        were an incredible time full of changes, unexpected things and challenges, failures as well as opportunities to
        work on myself. Currently, I am sitting on the train after a long day in Dresden, it is 19:43, I am alone and
        the golden evening light is illuminating my seat. It is a similar situation to in Barcelona I'm in right now,
        but the day went totally differently. I got first place at a competition, where I presented my apps and other
        businesses in front of an audience consisting of soon-to-be entrepreneurs and real entrepreneurs as well.</p>

    <p>The presentation lasted 2:30 minutes and went something like this.<br>
        "What's 16 + 17? It's 37. I have had problems with this as well, so… and then I learned how to program at the
        end of 2020 … and now I have a blog, a YouTube channel, and yesterday I created 4 different ads, so now my real
        story begins!"
    </p>

    <p>So, if I have proven to myself to everyone that I am capable, why not use the 2-hour ride to my hometown to set
        up the ad campaigns? This would transform this day from a very good one into an exceptional one. I created a new
        YouTube channel, gave it a profile picture, wrote the description, and linked my Google Ads account, I completed
        a questionnaire and got started. Parallel to this, I have updated my app to reflect the newest changes in regard
        to the app's setup. At this time, it was already getting dark and the sky had a red - dark blue gradient and the
        trees parallel to the tracks were already completely black. Setting up 1 ad campaign, which I did, took 1 hour.
    </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>I know that if I am able to get downloads in the magnitude of 100 or 1 000 it will save me years of natural
        growth because the first 100 downloads are the hardest to get. Currently, it is Sunday, the 20th of August, and
        tomorrow I have to go to school again, this was my last summer holiday. I have set up 1 ad campaign with 1 video
        and it failed - I made a few mistakes. </p>

    <p>What am I expecting? If it was that easy, why should it be desirable? It needs to be hard to challenge me and to
        create growth. I know that 1 successful ad is able to make a difference, so this ad won't come on the first try,
        rather it will take a non-insignificant amount of time. I need to <a href="blog_47.html"><em>act, assess, and
                adjust</em></a>, I will try until I
        win.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Failures kill" is the original title of the text, and I think I need to explain it a bit further. Imagine, every
        time you make a decision, your life splits into a few branches and every other decision splits your life into a
        few branches again. Failures show, that your branch was the wrong one and saw this branch of the tree of
        decisions. If you decide fast, you will go further altogether but encounter more wrong decisions. On the
        contrary, moving slowly doesn't save you from wrong decisions, since you simply can't know.
    <p>

    <p>I have written, that I am completely unpredictable in one of the first sentences, and now I will explain why: "I
        hesitated and build up fear because of what it may reveal" sounds like a love story as well as an
        entrepreneurial journey, and that is because they are the same thing, called <em>life</em>. </p>
