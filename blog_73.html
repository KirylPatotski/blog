    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">The key to worldly success</span></h1>

    <h1>Competence</h1>

    <p>I watched multiple YouTube videos on how to be more articulate, find the right words, and explain hard concepts
        vividly. There are multiple powerful techniques, such as using more suitable and expressive words instead of
        “using good words”, another technique is to implement a leading question and revolve your talking around it.
        It's also best to assume nothing and to repeat the core question over again. So, what is the key to worldly
        success? Other powerful speaking skills include gesticulation to visualize better, and dynamic composition of
        speed, breaks, slowness, loudness, and quietness. You can practice articulating better with the help of poetry
        for instance, as they are very dynamic. Yet, the first and most important thing to be an excellent speaker is to
        be ruthlessly competent in your area and to think everything through. It doesn't matter how great of a speaker
        you are if you don't know what to say.</p>

    <p>Therefore, competence is the key to clear and expressive speaking and competence is the key to anything. </p>

    <p>It could end right here, but competence transcends into every area: how did I get competent? It does matter what
        hard skills (=skills you could write on your resume) you are starting with. The criteria are the following, and
        everyone must be fulfilled to at least 80%.</p>

    <p>1. Testing ground for life</p>

    <p>Your learned skill must contain a wide variety of areas, which should be preferably unrelated. For instance,
        programming or video editing per se are complex, yet alone they are useless because the direction is missing. If
        you learn to program, for example, you need to learn how to market, organize, scale, design, and write. These
        skills are unrelated to programming, but they are needed to gain success in these fields, because programming
        alone, that's useless. The same applies to video editing, for instance, you would need to learn how to speak,
        record, write, and so on. Your core skill must include other skills. These side skills should be in great
        variety, touching every area of life.</p>

    <p>2. Challenge and demand</p>

    <p>It's self-evident, yet, learning a skill no one needs or that isn't particularly hard, doesn't accelerate on the
        path to competence. Knitting can be enjoyable, but this won't make you into a hyper-competent person. You could
        still learn how to market your knitting, but this violates this principle categorically. It must be a skill,
        where companies would hire you, also if you possessed this skill only. Preferably it should be digital and
        scalable. Knitting isn't scalable, but programming is. You can't work on more expensive knitting, but you can
        work in more difficult programming areas. Easy things (especially hobbies) are also problematic, because
        improving there doesn't mean the enjoyment grows, like it would for hard things.</p>

    <p>3. Instant feedback</p>

    <p>You can't start with organization as a skill, because it must be something you have to do on your own and with
        instant feedback. Programming is known for error messages, that is instant feedback. While organization isn't
        something you can do alone it has only delayed feedback. You don't press a button to find out if you have been
        correct. Instant feedback also removes skills such as social competence, as social competence isn't something
        with instant feedback either. It's not something you do in front of other people or with delay. It's something
        you do in front of your computer, with instant feedback. Without instant feedback, it's impossible to learn
        effectively. </p>

    <p>4. Core skill</p>

    <p>You should start with the core skill and every metric applies to the core skill itself. It's not recommended to
        start with marketing before you have an app. Teaching is only possible if you are competent elsewhere, that's
        why you aren't allowed to start with teaching.</p>

    <p>I want you to critically ask yourself if your skill has been the right one. If it shows cracks, don't worry. You
        can still go back to a better skill.</p>

    <p>Regardless of what your initial pick for a hard skill was, some skills have always a high return on investment.
        Thinking, writing, speaking, sales, leadership, and marketing. You may feel a slight dislike towards these
        things, but, don't worry, you will reach a level, where they become self-evident and fun! “Yes, I want to learn
        this” To delete some negativity right away, it's always called the “best-selling” book, not the “best-written”
        one. </p>

    <p>It should be mentioned, that competence is relevant both as an employee as well as an entrepreneur.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Now, you know what you should do, or at least know what you must not pursue. <em>Now you know, where you come from
        and where you are going.</em> Let's talk about the importance of ruthless competence. </p>

    <p><em>“I don't want to do this, that's not right”</em>, <em>“Well, no, that's how you do it”</em>, <em>“No”</em> and <em>“I've had enough”</em> are all
        things you can dare to say if you are the most competent person in the room. The best thing, is no one will
        think bad of you for doing this, because it's expected. On the contrary, if you keep quiet while everyone knows
        about your competence, people will think less of you and they and you will lose respect. The person who knows
        the most about something must be the leader, otherwise a worse-suited person would be required to take
        responsibility and lead. Responsibility… Doesn't that sound familiar?</p>

    <p><em>“You are late, but that's alright”</em> If you are the most competent person, people will start to forgive more. For
        instance, if you should say something uncareful, it won't be understood as an insult, but rather as a bad joke.
        That means people will defend you! This however doesn't happen when you show incompetence or weakness. It's okay
        to show flaws, but it's unacceptable to be dull. Companies won't notice your late arrival if you bring the most
        money in. This makes you <em>free</em>, giving you more freedom. People will fear you, even if you are socially
        talented, that's why you won't need to be scared of anything. </p>

    <p><em>“Your delivery is late, but I think that's because they are making it even better”</em> If everything you did was of
        excellent quality, then a late delivery will be interpreted as you putting in the extra work, rather than you
        being lazy or foolish. </p>

    <p>“I think you have a nice outfit, where did it come from” You will start people to respect you. </p>

    <p><em>“[skill] is hard, and fun”</em> If you excel at something difficult, such as programming, it becomes fun! You start to
        enjoy your work, the chunk of the day with the highest weight. That's beautiful and this thing alone should
        already be reason enough to prioritize mastery. </p>

    <p><em>“You are the leader, so…”</em> and <em>“I want”</em> Let's say, you got people to work for your vision, instead of working for
        someone else's. That's only possible to achieve with the help of competence. As a competent person, you lead and
        dictate your value, your salary, or price.</p>

    <p>Other things aren't tied to specific questions, but it's excellent for your mental and physical health as well as
        for your love life to be competent, as it removes negatives of the mind such as stress, meaning, a billionaire
        is less stressed than a normal worker, as the worker has to be more careful, while the competent person is the
        eagle, fast, elegant, dangerous, high in the air and relaxed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>If you need more incentive to become competent, print this text and mark this passage:</p>

    <p>Things competence gives</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Respect</li>
        <li>Status</li>
        <li>Forgivingness</li>
        <li>Removes negatives of the mind</li>
        <li>People work for your vision = Meaning + Fulfilment</li>
        <li>Fun</li>
        <li>Relaxation</li>
        <li>Money</li>
        <li>Freedom</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are 2 more: if you mastered worldly success, you can dedicate time towards spiritual matters and competence
        allows you to pick the right woman. Both of these things will have an enormous positive impact on your life.
        <br>If you are still not convinced, suppose the opposite. Being slow, clumsy, irrelevant, and at the bottom. The
        choice is yours, what's better?
    </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>You don't have to tell anyone how sharp you are if you are working for someone else. There is a better to do it,
        a more fun one: at first, you pretend to be an idiot, a typical 16-year-old. There will be low expectations and
        you will be treated like a child. You may say, that you will need a lot of time. Then, after the conversation is
        over, you massively overdeliver, both quality and time-wise. Then, you are the competent one. Congratulations.
    </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Well, what is the secret key to material success? Is it the access to the right resources and people? Will rich
        friends help you to become successful or maybe the right university? Perhaps, you just need the right IQ and
        everything should work out your way. Maybe you need to get simply blessed.</p>

    <p>Every one of the things I just listed has its problems. The major problem is the nonexistence of control. No one
        is truly able to pick these quantities. You are either born moronic, in the wrong environment, with little
        available recourses instead of abundance. </p>

    <p>How can you overcome all of these obstacles?</p>

    <p>With competence.</p>

    <p>With competence, you can gain freedom, respect, forgiveness, material success, and status. Everything the
        material world has to offer. </p>

    <p><em>“I don't want to this, that's nonsense”</em> and people will listen. You come too late and people don't seem to
        notice. Be valuable and dictate your price. Be viewed as the one who has achieved everything. Have no longer
        have any insecurities, because you know better and more.</p>

    <p>Anyone can become competent, a master. Once you become competent in one area, you have already laid the
        foundation for everything else. It's only problematic at the beginning when everything works against you because
        you have not become competent yet.</p>
