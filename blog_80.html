  <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Learn from the mistakes of others</span></h1>

  <h1>Skip that nonsense</h1>

  <p>I have lived in Minsk, the capital city of Belarus, with 2 million inhabitants. This city is green, intuitively
    designed (called 15-minute city design), public transit, and car-friendly at the same time, full of things to do and
    to see. This city also has a unique, and consistent style on its own. When I moved to Germany, at the age of 5 in
    early 2013, I saw Germany for the first time. Of course, as a five-year-old, you know that some countries have more
    money than others, and I saw how Germany looked. I saw dirt, homelessness, degeneracy, broken facades, ruined houses
    in city centers, “street art” and poor design from a city planning perspective. Luckily, things have gotten
    drastically better in the last 10 years, now there are fewer ruins in the center of the city I live in. </p>

  <p>I have been to Belarus, Lithuania, Germany, Poland, Czechia, Austria, Türkiye, The Canarian Islands, Catalonia,
    Greece, Turkey, Greece, and Egypt. What did I learn while staying while being there? “Cultures are different” and
    “People in the south are poorer and more relaxed” That's it, no more. Other, smaller details that were visible are
    not worth remembering, because much more time would be necessary and <em>it's the same everywhere</em>. However, I lived in
    2 cities completely opposing themselves, one with 2 million inhabitants and one with “street art” What did I learn
    from that? I learned that where you like to live doesn't depend on how pretty it's there, because beauty comes at a
    price too, but rather on how long you have been living there and that's why <em>it's the same everywhere</em>. After 2020,
    when I have been living in Germany for 7 years, I started to enjoy it and now, in 2023 I even don't want to move
    anywhere else, because I have come to realize that it's the same everywhere!</p>

  <p>It's about you, you will adapt fight, and hate changes, you will feel indifferent, get used so to speak and later
    you will accept it as the only option. These are the 3 stages of change, conceptualized by Schopenhauer. Change is
    going to be even harder, especially if you have been living somewhere for decades, therefore it's not worth it.
    Eventually, you will have to settle in one place, so why not choose your home place as the place to settle? You will
    learn to enjoy your place more and more as time passes.</p>

  <p>Considering that moving somewhere is hard, many people who move to another country or for example from East to West
    Germany, surprisingly many people return eventually and learn the hard way what it means to be tempted by a higher
    salary. </p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Now, that it fits in the text, here is why moving to Dubai or the USA is nonsense.</p>

  <p>First let's talk about the benefits: it feels cool, there are more freedoms, there are fewer/no taxes and Dubai is
    safe and clean.</p>

  <p>Now let's look at the disadvantages: you can't go for walks, you can't drink tap water, it's hot, things are
    expensive, you will be banned from visiting your home country for more than 90 days a year, otherwise you will have
    to pay taxes in your home country again, the air is polluted and no one stays forever. As a result, your health will
    drop, your most valuable asset.</p>

  <p>If every micro-moment is worse in these countries, for example, you can't go for a walk in the US, because
    pedestrian zones are often missing and in Dubai it's simply too hot and no one stays forever, how is that compatible
    with thinking long term and minimizing regret? To add further arguments: earn more before worrying about taxes, and
    analyze if that's even your own desire. I noticed that it was an inauthentic one.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Let's go back to our original scenario of the country or city to live in. Let's now extend this further. </p>

  <p>Do you remember the text <a href="blog_6.html">#6</a>, “The only way to live”? Its main message was to avoid regret
    and to think long-term.
    The text also explained how to look at things from the perspective of your deathbed. What do you think are the most
    common regrets from people taking their final breaths? </p>


  <ul>
    <li>“I wish I would have spent more time with my loved ones, friends, and family, instead of wasting my time at work
      and enjoying myself more¹”</li>

    <li>“I wish I was more authentic, and stayed true to myself instead of listening to others. My feelings should have
      been expressed better and my life structured according to my authentic self.”</li>

    <li>“I wish I didn't waste my time, sacrifice my health, my future, and love by being aimless, a collection of bad
      habits and promiscuous.”</li>

    <li>“I wish I learned earlier that happiness comes from my mind.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As you can see, none of these common regrets include: “I wish tried everything out, lived in 100 different
    countries, and figured out what was right for me” or to make it more extreme: “I wish I was more promiscuous, tried
    everything out, slept with 100 different people and figured out what was right for me, after all, how am I supposed
    to know it, when I haven't experienced everything.” </p>

  <p>Don't repeat mistakes others have done and regret, especially if you know about them. If the mistake includes
    something “fun”, remember, that it's more fun in your mind than in reality. Do you feel good before, while, or after
    eating sugar, for example? It gets even more regretful if the mistake wasn't even your desire, but rather an
    inauthentic one. Also, trying out many things creates even more regret, because when do you know when you found the
    best option if there are always more and more? What makes the best pick even the best option? Wanting more and more
    doesn't create happiness either. Not wanting anything creates freedom.</p>

  <p><em>Skip that nonsense, and learn from others instead.</em> You don't want to take examples from people who haven't
    figured anything out themselves, take advice from people who are more experienced, smarter, and older than you and
    listen. Digging yourself a hole when there's a warning not to do so on a red sign created by those who did, don't
    listen to the people digging with you, but rather those who knew it was a mistake. Did you learn math in school from
    your peers or a teacher? If you learned from your peers, did they teach you higher, <em>real</em> math? Skip that nonsense.
  </p>

  <p>It's easy not to learn from others and have to learn it on your own because it makes you look stupid, but looking
    stupid, most of the time only to yourself, is temporary, while regret stays, it's <em>long term</em>. Do you want your
    final days to be in the theme of “I used to be so stupid when I was younger, now it's too late” or “I have lived a
    great life, because I learned from the mistakes of others, instead of the hardest way possible.”</p>


  <h1>Regret, how to avoid it</h1>

  <p><strong>“I wish I would have spent more time with my loved ones, friends, and family, instead of wasting my time at
      work and enjoying myself more”</strong></p>

  <p>First of all, if you are a teenager, of course, you are sick of your parents. You have changed too drastically and
    wanted to move on, yet your parents stayed as a relic of your former, stupid, unconscious self. Furthermore,
    unresolvable conflicts emerge during puberty, and there is nothing you can do about it. There is a detail, that's
    often lost in the process: you have been spending almost 2 consecutive decades together, no wonder you are tired of
    your parents! At the same time, you start to think for yourself and get a desire to do your own thing and that's all
    right. For a few years, you may do what you want and move to another city but eventually, you may return. </p>

  <p>Yes, to avoid this regret, you must remain in a driving distance to your relatives. You can't move anywhere you
    want unless it's in this period of self-discovery. Traditionally, daughters always stay by their families. If you
    constantly move, it will be impossible to establish meaningful friendships and relationships as well as family,
    because these take time, around 5 years. Geographic distance is the biggest reason for the collapse of existing
    friendships. Effectively a friendship stops being a close one, if you start to see each other infrequently.</p>

  <p>Now here I have the most expertise, how to not avoid working hard and rewarding yourself too little. I worked with
    high intensity on multiple projects, and I only regret committing to other's people visions, meaning, working for
    others, not on things I value. If you see value in something, you will enjoy working towards it, even more, if it's
    your own thing and others keep supporting it. If that's the case, huge parts of rewarding yourself will become
    redundant, as your work constitutes a reward. Working for a higher salary on something you don't care about or
    dislike will lead to regret! Regret is a negative of the mind, and negatives of the mind tell you that something
    isn't going the way it's supposed to. It's unnatural to be materialistic, of course, you are going to regret that.
  </p>

  <p>Rewarding yourself shouldn't happen with things that harm you. Alcohol, for example. You can reward yourself with a
    nice bath, a walk, or if you are still a bit (just a bit ;-)) materialistic, a vacation. Going on a vacation doesn't
    mean, you need to eat sugar there.</p>

  <p>Let's go back to an old person, who sacrificed pleasure, culinary and materialistic. Now that person may have some
    money and buy something like a dress. She will learn, that the dress never made her happy in the first place, but
    her family did.</p>

  <p>Talking about family, kids, and marriage, you are not going to regret them either, because there is not much that's
    lost in the process. How many “nice things alone” do you have to keep doing to realize how meaningless they are? Of
    course, it's easier to go for dinner when you are alone or as a couple, but just like eating sugar, it's greater in
    the mind a priori than in reality a posteriori. Also, even if you have kids, who stop you from going to restaurants?
    Your children may be well-behaved (if you reach such texts, I think you should have no problem doing that) and if
    not, you still have <em>your</em> parents. </p>

  <p>It's better to spend your last days with your children than with your cat and photos of how you went for dinner
    alone your whole life.</p>

  <p><strong>“I wish I was more authentic, and stayed true to myself instead of listening to others. My feelings should
      have been expressed better and my life structured according to my authentic self.”</strong></p>

  <p>I have written a lot about authenticity. What about dying your hair? Is that an authentic desire of yours? What are
    your wants in the first place and what has been implanted in your mind from other people? Asses your desires and
    life like you want. It's as simple as that when written down in a guide. Assessing your desires is just as easy and
    can be done on paper as well. Expressing yourself is necessary because otherwise a stronger person will express
    themselves and get what they wanted. Most of the time asking is free and has no downsides, but high upsides. Telling
    others about your problems helps too, how is anyone supposed to know what you want, if you don't make it clear? </p>

  <p>You shouldn't forget what communication is for. Storytelling is a tool to higher your social hierarchy, by sounding
    more engaging and interesting. Gossiping is a bad habit. Listening to others and communicating with a clear intent
    returns results: “I want ...”</p>

  <p>Be authentic in what you want and say because inauthenticity is severely punished. You never get what you want,
    others and you lose respect for you, and others will use you instead. Authenticity also means, thinking for yourself
    and not listening to ideology and beliefs as well as opinions not coming from yourself. </p>

  <p><strong>“I wish I didn't waste my time, sacrifice my health, my future, and love by being aimless, a collection of
      bad habits and promiscuous.”</strong></p>

  <p>This simply comes down to having a vision and discipline. Be strong and avoid weakness and hedonism from taking
    over your life. </p>

  <p><strong>“I wish I learned earlier that happiness comes from my mind.”</strong></p>

  <p>No event is ever going to lead to increased happiness, rather a fixed life and mind will lead to well-being. I
    think I wrote a text about recently… </p>

  <p><a href="blog_77.html">#</a> “Negatives of the mind” is a full guide to reaching happiness in the mind. It takes
    around 1 hour to read, and this hour will be time spent with an immense return on investment.</p>

  <h1>I've messed up</h1>

  <p>You may say “What you say is nice, but I messed up” Remember these things. You are not alone. I've made mistakes
    too. If you talk with others about them, you may see people with much worse mistakes. After all, we don't live in
    <em>paradise</em>. I would recommend using another approach instead, one described in the guide on how to get rid of
    <a href="blog_63.html">traumas</a> It's by taking control, writing about it, and then breaking free in a symbolic ritual.</p>

  <p>You have to live with the new change to avoid further regret. It's better to change now than later. Later doesn't
    exist, you only exist in the current moment. I had a lot of regrets because I've made a lot of mistakes, but I have
    no real regrets anymore because I moved on. Now, these regrets are weak and dramatic, just like a small milestone in
    the middle of a city reminding in golden letters what tragedy happened there a long time ago.</p>

  <p>Regret is the key to forgiving, by moral and legal law. Forgivingness is one of the leading principles of
    Christianity. Let those regrets be warnings, and view and accept them as such.</p>

  <h1>Regret minimization, summary</h1>

  <p>If you want to minimize regret further, you need to listen to your mind as well as your heart. It also means, that
    to learn from other people's mistakes, you need to think long-term and independently from results. Do what you are
    supposed to. Act categorically (=independent of context, a priori) and stay morally correct with your acting as
    well. </p>

  <p>A date fell from a palm as I went on a little walk today. I picked up the fresh and golden date, cleaned it, and
    ate it. I have never seen a date falling from a palm before, and the palms protect their fruits with their height.
    But the fruit got in my reach and I took it. Its seed is now in my pocket.</p>

  <p><a href="blog_52.html">#</a> Do, even if the probable outcome is a failure. The biggest risk is not taking risks at all. </p>
