    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Don't look at results, they come in the end.</span></h1>

    <h1>Do it anyway</h1>

    <p>In philosophy, there are 2 main concepts on how to judge an action, by itself or by its result. Judging by the
        result is called teleological ethics and judging by the action itself is called deontological ethics. That
        means, an action can either be morally correct by looking at the result (teleological) or by the action itself,
        regardless of the outcome (deontological).</p>

    <p>Teleological ways of thinking suggest that you are responsible for the outcome of an action, rather than the
        action itself. This causes multiple problems:</p>

    <p>Uncertainty and responsibility at the same time </p>

    <p>Most of the time, you have almost no control over the output of some event, because you are not alone in this
        world, rather many small factors decide more than you want to acknowledge, therefore it would be impossible to
        attribute the blame to one person alone. Things are simply too complex. That means responsibility is not
        considered in teleological thinking as much as in deontological thinking, because it only looks at the uncertain
        results and in the future. That causes the problem of responsibility for the future self and ignores current
        responsibility as well. Should you be responsible for your future self? Responsibility for the future self is
        not morally correct, because you can't be judged for something you have not done or where the consequences have
        not happened, especially if this thing is uncertain. Responsibility for the past self is possible because of
        causality, which creates logic, but being responsible for the future self breaks logic and causality and
        therefore truth. The future doesn't exist and only the current moment is real as well as the recent past.</p>

    <p>No absolute and universal truth</p>

    <p>In math, things are true, or they are defined to be true, which means, 1 + 1 = 2 is correct because the
        definitions for addition, equality, and numbers have already been defined and these definitions allow statements
        to be true, false, or undecidable and nothing else. That means, 1 + 1 = 2 is always true and there is nothing
        else to it, no external event that can cause it to turn false, because it is derived from axioms and definition.
        There is nothing random that can happen and there are no exceptions. Teleological thinking would therefore allow
        1 + 1 to be equal to 3 sometimes, with the explanation, that the environment changes and that there are things
        that are true by themselves, furthermore Teleological thinking would remove definitions and make everything
        mathematical useless because these true-itself things would cease to exist.</p>

    <p>Unsustainability</p>

    <p>Teleological actions are often unsustainable. Let's suppose you wanted to grow your business, which may have a
        great purpose and mission with an overall net positive for the world. How would you grow your business, if the
        way to grow it didn't matter and anything would be allowed to reach the desired destination?</p>

    <p>Results come in the end</p>

    <p>Most of the time, or at least often, you are doing things for the first time in your life, and therefore you lack
        the proper knowledge and experience. So, how would you decide what actions to take, if you have too much
        uncertainty? There has to be a way to look at an action itself and to verify its integrity and value, by itself
        - because the results come at the end and not in the beginning, while the beginning is the phase where decisions
        have to be made. If you lack data, use philosophy. In this case, this philosophy requires the data before the
        action, which is not useful, if you had data, you would use math instead. </p>

    <p>In essence, the problems of teleological thinking are unresolvable, and the definition of deontological thinking
        is able to strip the fundament of teleological thinking because deontological thinking looks for a universal,
        absolute, certain, and pre-determined system, just like math, for example. That, in turn, means that 2 systems
        cannot be applicable at the same, and one has to be better than the other one, in this case, the deontological
        system is more universal and “stronger” because it doesn't allow for exceptions, but the teleological one does.
        <br>Deontological thinking is able to solve all of these problems exceptionally well.
    </p>

    <p>Certainty and responsibility</p>

    <p>Because there is a lot of uncertainty, there has to be a way to make the right decisions separated from the
        outcome, because you are not responsible for the outcome of your actions but you are very much responsible for
        your actions themselves, because the decisions for your action always happen in the current moment instead of
        the future like the outcome does, and therefore you are able to accountable for them. It resolves the conflict
        of future responsibility.</p>

    <p>Absolute and universal truth to avoid contradictions</p>

    <p>Instead of assessing every situation, you need to create systems of absolute truth, such as math for example,
        because these systems are more stable. Let me put it this way. If you do research, is it better to look at a
        conclusion and then to derive the reasons or is it better to look at the reasons and derive the conclusion? If
        conclude something and then try to find the reasons to back it up, you are in danger of great illusions, since
        the world offers enough evidence for any conclusion, which may not be the right one. Getting a conclusion and
        trying to prove it is the equivalent of doing something and then justifying it. That's the logic of a
        5-year-old, and not of real thinkers in my opinion. There needs to be a system of absolute and universal truth
        such as math, in order to create consistency because inconsistency causes contradictions. Contradictions show
        flaws in systems and systems are not allowed to have contradictions if these systems need to be useful. For
        example, 1 + 1 = 2 and 1 + 2 = 2 are not allowed to be true at the same time, but simply looking at the results
        would not necessarily disallow these contradictions to exist. Now, you may be tempted to think that math and
        philosophy contain contradictions - that's not true, because contradictions are removed by definitions, even if
        only in the future.</p>

    <p>Sustainability</p>

    <p>A system that does not allow a result “by all means”, is better because it removes any possibility of doing
        something morally wrong in advance.</p>

    <p>Results come in the end</p>

    <p>Yes, if you don't know if an action is going to benefit yourself or others because of its uncertainty, you need
        to assess this decision in advance to judge it - that's what deontological thinking is in essence, it's trying
        to prevent missteps.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Now, this is where a classical philosophical argumentation would end, but… What does uncertainty even mean? </p>

    <p>It means that some things need to be done even if the probable outcome is failure. If you aren't seeing results,
        you still need to keep pushing, because results are not guaranteed or fast. You need to keep pushing until you
        fail or succeed. If you lack data or knowledge, you will still be able to differentiate between right and wrong
        in advance. You can still fail if you have done everything correctly because there is simply too much
        uncertainty and results can therefore project wrong things in the context of self-development. Whenever someone
        makes a decision, one often receives feedback for it, called validation. Can you be validated for the wrong
        things, yes you can and the opposite can happen as well - the results can be misleading, even if this occurs
        only on the basis of human irrationality.</p>

    <p>It means, you need to keep uploading YouTube videos, even if you get no views, it means you need to go to the
        gym, even if you see no results, and it means you need to create great products, even if no one buys them,
        because all of these things are temporary and don't reflect your overall mission. In order to minimize regret
        and grow, you need to keep fighting, as this is <a href="blog_6.html">the only way to live</a> and - <em>do it
            anyway</em>.</p>

    <p>Appendix: Where a priori breaks </p>

    <p>
        Modern math has brought to light instances where the concept of "a priori" (before experience/result) and “a
        posterior” (experience/result) break down. In contemporary mathematics, propositions can exist in a state of
        being true, false, or undecidable simultaneously - or simply break altogether. This phenomenon has the potential
        to lead to contradictions when attempting to establish definitions or principles in certain contexts. The
        intricate nature of modern mathematical systems highlights the inherent complexity that can emerge when
        attempting to rely solely on a priori (deontological) reasoning. That means math which is supposedly
        “unbreakable” and a priori and always true and always creates the same results under the same circumstance has
        some uncoverable holes. To “solve” these massive problems many new mathematical fields had to be created, the
        most famous one being computer science. For example, there is no way to create an algorithm that gets an
        algorithm as input, and the algorithm is supposed to figure out if the input algorithm will stop because it is
        undecidable. Other algorithms, such as “Game of Life” by Conway also break the concept of a priori and a
        posterior break apart and become meaningless.
    </p>

    <p>Now, you may be tempted to think that algorithms are not subject to ethics, but what differentiates mathematical
        actions from human ones? </p>
