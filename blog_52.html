    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Don't look at results; they come in the end.</span></h1>

    <h1>Do it anyway</h1>

    <p><strong>Part one. On giving.</strong></p>

    <p><em>Look at the inputs and not the outputs. The outputs naturally follow the inputs. People will go to massive
            lengths to look for cute little hacks rather than actually putting in the effort. Most are so concerned
            about results before they even start doing it that it's unbelievable. </em></p>

    <p><em><strong>In life, you give to get.</strong></em> I went from negative status to a school legend because I went
        above and beyond. I created photos and movies that people liked a lot. I never hesitated to express gratitude
        and goodwill in the group chat. Often, I was the only one to do it. It wasn’t my clearly visible monumental
        achievements and the indomitable spirit that brought me status; it was my effort. Hence, giving is not just an
        act, it's a powerful investment in your own success. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Sometimes, giving a bit does wonders.</strong></em> I know an actual jerk, yet he taught me
        something. He had an expensive car because he enjoyed bragging. We were driving through the car wash one day,
        and he tipped the car-washing guy. He explained that the car washer has a place in life, and giving him a few
        extra cents relaxes any negativity and has an exceptional return on the service. Likewise, remembering a
        person’s birthday or favorite sweet is always worth it. </p>

    <p><em><strong>You have to give a lot.</strong></em> While providing very little can often yield fantastic results,
        sometimes you have to go above and beyond. How many videos do you need to create to gain significant traction?
        Around two hundred and fifty. Most would be worried about creating thumbnails rather than making many good
        videos. Anything worth struggling for requires plenty of sacrifice. Hence, you have to get used to doing it
        without expecting anything. </p>

    <p><em><strong>The list of examples is endless.</strong></em> Studying more yields better grades. Exceptional
        products attract money. At a job, you do more to get more pay, not vice versa. Cleaning your diet enhances
        energy and focus. It’s the input that you give that matters for what you get.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Never underestimate the power of giving.</strong></em> I was once told that my voice sounded nearly
        ecstatic, and I created videos. Do you see the connection? I once told a guy at the gym that I'm proud of him
        for giving his best. How do you think he felt? I may come off as arrogant in my texts, and I am because I know
        what I'm talking about. Most people are starved of compliments. A sincere compliment can change lives.</p>

    <p>You don’t get what you give; you get more.</p>

    <p>Giving is an investment.</p>

    <p><strong>Part two. On success and giving</strong></p>

    <p>While you give, you win.</p>

    <p>Even if you gave me a billion euros, nothing significant would change. If you took everything away from me and
        locked me up, not much would change either. I would still write purposeful texts, train hard, and meditate. This
        is why I consider myself the most successful person on the planet.</p>

    <p>Many people mistake success for results. Success isn’t a future goal; it exists in the present moment. If you
        align with it, results will follow. Showing up, doing the brave thing, and staying focused – that’s success. If
        you make the right decision, no matter how insignificant, you progress. As long as you keep going, you haven’t
        lost. Persist long enough, and you’ll see results.</p>

    <p>In marriage, success means not getting divorced. In business, it means not running out of cash. In life, it means
        staying alive. Therefore, as long as you can give, you are winning. As long as you don’t give up, you haven't
        lost.</p>

    <p><strong>Part three. Do, even if the probable outcome is failure</strong></p>

    <p><em><strong>Results come at the end, and decisions are made at the beginning.</strong></em> Being able to detach
        effort from results is vital for success. Things take time. Momentum is only visible when it becomes
        unstoppable. Most things only show results after a long time. </p>

    <p><em><strong>There is no absolute and universal truth.</strong></em> There are an infinite number of perspectives,
        and you cannot underestimate the power of the mind. There’s no central authority outside of God. He establishes
        the laws, but what you do with those laws is your choice. – You may as well do the brave thing.</p>

    <p><em><strong>You control your actions, not the outcome.</strong></em> Rarely do things go in life like you want
        them to do. You aren’t alone. While the output is uncertain, you have control of the actions you take. You don’t
        know if she says yes, but you know very well that you must take the step. Only the present moment is real; the
        past can’t be changed, and the future doesn’t exist. Because life is uncertain, you must try even if the
        probable outcome is a failure.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Good intentions.</strong></em> You own nothing; what you own are your thoughts and intentions.
        Keeping your soul often means trying, even if the probable outcome is a failure. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Monumental life.</strong></em> Do the brave thing because you want to live a monumental life, have crazy stories, and not regret a single second of your life. Sometimes, the fear of loss is smaller than the fear of not trying.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Do, even if the probable outcome is failure.</em></p>
