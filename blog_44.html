    <h1>Elevated state of mind</h1>

    <p>Your life will never look like a fairy tale, because those aren't real, but your life can look like an
        inspirational story. In the last 4 months, with the exception of June, I have been in a constant state of mind,
        which I never foresaw to be attainable. It's very hard to grasp this, and even harder to achieve, but if you
        want to gain an insight into such a state of mind, we have to start at the beginning. That means, I have only
        lived with such a mind for a relatively short amount of time, and my essay will therefore lack extraordinary
        complexity.</p>

    <p>1. Flow</p>

    <p>Some people consider the flow to be extremely hard to achieve and it is, but the more often you achieve such a
        state, the easier it becomes. Flow happens when you focus on your task intense enough, and for a prolonged
        period of time without any interruptions or distractions. You morph into the task so to speak. Now, as you are
        reading this, you have probably thoughts outside of this text, and that's normal if you are just starting -
        perhaps some readers have already forgotten what the first sentence was. But I don't think about anything else
        while writing text, I don't have any thoughts at all. As I am writing this text, I only look at the words,
        letter by letter and some ambient music is playing in the background. I don't know how long I have been writing
        so far because I didn't look away from the letters on my computer screen and have no sensory input except the
        fingers moving on my keyboard and the quiet, soft, relaxing music playing in my background, which I don't even
        hear unless I am paying attention towards it. Whenever I focus hard enough, I don't hear anything playing in the
        background - I know that my flow is over when I start to hear something. Whenever I am recording YouTube videos
        something strange occurs: I turn blind. As I sit at my desk and talk, I see everything clearly, but then
        everything slowly morphs into a black indifference, and my words become the only reality. This sense of flow can
        last up to 2 hours at a time. For example, the text “Stay away from me” was 3200 words long and only created in
        2 sessions, the first session being 3 hours in duration and the second one of 2 hours. </p>

    <p>It's very hard to comprehend, how much more focused you can be if you are in a state of flow. That's how I am
        able to outwork 10 people, even if they have significantly more expertise than me. Let me give you an example.
        On the 29th of July, I recorded 5 YouTube videos, in 3 hours. Normally a feat like this takes several days or
        even weeks. You can do it in one day. Things take as long as you want them to. The state of flow, combined with
        extreme dedication, ambition, and skill leads to extreme results. In the tech industry, there is the concept of
        a 10x developer. They are real. Those are people with so immense problem-solving skills and the right work
        ethic, that they alone are able to replace a whole team. But those people don't get 10x the compensation, it's
        more like 20x-100x the compensation. It goes even further than that, because the creator of Bitcoin, could be
        considered a 1000x developer - that's why now he is a billionaire, and so is the creator of Minecraft. It seems
        like normal people don't do anything in comparison to them and that's one of the reasons why I find it hard to
        relate to anyone's work. </p>

    <p>Before I got used to being in a flow state permanently, almost, I would stop the time I was doing actual work.
        That was in 2021 and 2022. Every time I programmed, I listened to specific music, a 3-hour playlist. My work
        days were 14 hours long at that time. Every time I took a break I would pause. After the whole day, I would only
        get together for something like 4 hours of actual work and the rest consisted of wasted micro-moments. This is
        already twice the average of 2 hours of actual work per day, but can still be massively improved - I thought.
        After I tried to push this measure to the extreme, I could perform 8 hours of actual work - and burned out in
        June 2023. Only now, as I go for 2-hour walks and for 1 hour to the gym every day, I am able to sustain it, but
        still for no more than 5 hours a day. I don't know how relatable this is, but most of the time people “work”
        they are not actually doing anything - their mind has not advanced enough. Your work can consist of just
        meaningful tasks, it's a lie that it can't. Of course, you will still have to do certain things such as writing
        reports or doing some paper stuff - but this stuff is outside of your sphere of influence anyway. Do you think
        that the creator of Bitcoin focused on paperwork? No, it's more likely that he focused solely on the hard tasks
        because anything else can be outsourced. You would be wasting your time and potential trying to do meaningless,
        “necessary” tasks. Try to fill a bowl with apples. You can still fit some grapes in your bowl, but now if you
        filled it with grapes first, you would have no space left for the apples. Your actual work can consist of just a
        meaningful task - don't focus on the grapes. </p>

    <p>2. Intelligence and knowledge</p>

    <p>My first YouTube video on my current main channel explains how to be more creative. I couldn't have imagined,
        that my own advice would become redundant later in life - because once you implement all of the lifestyle
        changes, and unleash your full potential, where does the actual creativity come from? I had an extreme, level of
        creativity in March, April, and May of 2023. It was so high, that I could write down 30 ideas for future YouTube
        videos in 5 minutes while creating the video on how to be creative. In May I could already write down 70 ideas -
        this continued until my burnout. I have unleashed my potential which was buried for years but after my burnout,
        in the present time, I don't need to be creative, since everything seems to come to me right now and I can think
        of anything I want to do in a creative way. I don't fully understand how that works, since I have too little
        experience in it right now. But one thing that used to foster creativity and knowledge was reading, I read a lot
        and watched a lot of YouTube and kept learning all the time, although I stopped watching videos in April 2023 -
        it was a mistake and now I do watch YouTube again - with a difference. I have come to the realization, that not
        the constant input of knowledge was causing immense output in creativity but something else, which I have not
        discovered now. </p>

    <p>In the last months, I have written approximately 70 000 words and read one magnitude above that. That gave me the
        ability to <em>think</em>. It was as if I was a pawn before and that I was unconscious all the time. I gained an
        incredible amount of knowledge, and perhaps even more because I started to implement the knowledge right away.
    </p>

    <p>My first authentic essay in this blog, which is now titled “The only way to live” was intended to have another
        title: “Thinking Long Term”. I have no short-term thoughts anymore - that makes it so much easier to resist
        pleasure</p>

    <p>3. Thoughts and presence</p>

    <p>I almost got rid of all negative thoughts, which is an absolute blessing, since you suffer more in imagination
        than in reality. Most of the negative scenarios don't occur that you frame in your mind and most of the negative
        scenarios that do happen don't happen in the worst-case scenario. If you lay in bed and have dark thoughts, you
        have big problems - that's why dark thoughts exist in the first place. As soon as you stop having dark thoughts,
        your life quality increases immensely. </p>

    <p>Earlier in life, as I felt “unconscious”, I still had some moments of total presence. They would come seemingly
        at random. It's very difficult to describe the sensation, but it feels as if you have just woken up from a dream
        you never entered. Suddenly you feel completely alive and everything seems to be indifferent, only your life and
        your experiences count at that moment. You can achieve this feeling almost permanently - and it goes hand in
        hand with any of the other aspects of an elevated state of mind. As I write this, I have in my mind, that if you
        stop having dark thoughts you automatically become more present. </p>

    <p>4. Happiness</p>

    <p>Suppose you advance to such a level yourself. You will learn, that everything else is not real life - you will
        start to think that your past self lived like a goldfish. You will come to the realization, that there is no
        alternative to total presence all of the time because being buried in your own thoughts was an illusion. If you
        move on past all fabricated desires like material once, you will discover, that this is the key to happiness and
        to the perfect life - like anything desirable, this is hard to achieve and a long process.</p>
