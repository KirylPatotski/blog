    <h1>Dear Mother,</h1>

    <p><strong><em>To your 39th birthday, summer 2023.</em></strong> Visualize everything you have ever done, no matter
        if it was right or wrong because now these days are gone anyway and every mistake of yours has already been
        forgiven and forgotten because I can't think of one. The two pictures that I have gifted you symbolize the flow
        of time and life's beautiful incompleteness. Hence, one of the frames is white, at the same time, the second one
        is black. The yang and yin. The white frame contains a picture of a red flower and a white background. This
        picture looks very elegant, the white part symbolizing purity and innocence and the red flower in the picture
        shows all of the sacrifices you made for us and especially for me. The other picture is in a black frame, trying
        to show all of the time you have ahead of you and the uncertainty this time is going to bring. But, I promise,
        that for you the hardest days are finally over and you can enjoy the second half of your beautiful, interesting,
        and full life as your heart desires, just like the yellow flower, full zest for life. Together, these pictures,
        frames, and colors as well as their meaning create a magic trinity, as magical as your existence itself, while
        completing themselves. </p>

    <p>I can't think of any things that I don't like about you since you are willing to improve. [â€¦] You are willing to
        sacrifice anything, just as you have demonstrated your whole life. I could ask you for anything and you would
        sacrifice. Other kids can only dream about this. You have helped me significantly in my personal development and
        have taken action all of the time. I got set up to win the game of life. For example, the programming course in
        2021. I like having my room too, it's beautiful. I enjoy being free, even if limited, I like gaining new
        experiences, and I like having you as my mother, so much that I am having tears in my eyes as I write this for
        one of the first times in 2023. </p>

    <p>I want to thank you for everything. </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br></p>

    <p>This is my 100th blog. What a milestone. 147,300 words. How much I developed as a person. Yet, it's all
        indifferent. There is much more to be done, much more to be fought for and this is just the beginning. I'm
        grateful for every challenge life gives me. I love my life, thanks to you.</p>
