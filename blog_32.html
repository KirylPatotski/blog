    <p>You suffer more in imagination than in real life, so I decided to google myself. As expected, you will find my 2
        YouTube channels, individual videos, and my apps. There are also some of “my” companies, or companies with
        names, coincidentally, creating software. Nothing unexpected so to speak, but there was one thing that shocked
        me. It was the 1100 results, most of which were fake. </p>

    <p>There is, originally a conspiracy theory, theory, that states that in the last couple of years everything almost
        everything on the internet is generated by scripts or artificial intelligence. While in its form, the conspiracy
        theory is rubbish, it contains a few valuable insights. </p>

    <p>First of all, if you watch YouTube, you will see almost no AI-generated content, which is of sufficient length
        and quality, but the many comments are fake, generated by bots. Second, you can't ignore, that 99.99% of the
        internet's content is completely invisible. Furthermore, creating bots costs almost nothing as well as fake
        messages.</p>

    <p>I think this theory is true, try it yourself, at your own risk. Otherwise, why would so many “people” suddenly
        write about me?</p>
