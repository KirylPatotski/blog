    <h1>Desires</h1>

    <p>Don't waste your life, and don't chase the wrong things, because they will start to chase you. Focus on the right
        things instead. </p>

    <p>You can still have clear thoughts on your own if you are the right kind of person. But perhaps, you need someone
        to keep your sanity. I talked with no one about anything, here is the method I used instead, in order for you to
        understand how <em>insanely</em> overpowered this method is, here is a demo: </p>

    <p>Desire: “I wish to have a supercar.” Now say it out loud. If you don't dare to, forget about it. If you find it
        still reasonable, try to break it down further. “I wish to have a supercar because I think it's cool, what else
        am I supposed to do with my money?” Break it down further, because you have not reached the point of the
        unbreakable reason. “I wish to have a supercar because I would like the appearance of it as well as its unique
        driving experience. I don't know what will be better to spend my money on, because I don't have any and it's
        therefore out of my scope of imagination” Now, break it down even further, start to factor in the negatives “I
        wish to have a supercar because I would like how it looks and feels in my garage and how I would look on photos
        on it, which people everywhere are going to see and suddenly I will gain more respect. I don't want to give my
        money to other people, if cars are supposedly a bad investment, what should I do?” </p>

    <p>Now you almost reached the core. “[…] I will gain more respect […]” Investigate further. Do you have more respect
        for people with supercars, really? What do you need respect for in the first place, it needs to be deserved. “I
        want more respect because I feel like a loser”. Why do you feel like a loser? Most of the time you would want to
        list a bunch of events here, but if you dig even deeper, you will notice, that these events have only single
        actions, that make you feel the need for more respect, and even these actions by others, like a comment were
        most likely not meant to disrespect. “I think that person A who made a joke 10 years ago drove down my
        self-esteem, and now I need to commit my life to a materialistic car. But I don't even know whether this joke
        was there to insult me in the first place. Maybe I just envy people on social media, because I think that they
        are better off than I am”</p>

    <p>Now, there you have it. Absolutely stupid desire, irrational, and based on incomplete impressions and
        half-truths. If you would tell someone “I think that person A who made a joke 10 years ago drove down my
        self-esteem, and now I need to commit my life to a materialistic car.” You will feel like an idiot for saying
        that. Well, congratulations. You have saved yourself so much time and energy by really assessing your desires.
        If something is true, you should have no problem going on stage in front of 1,000 people and saying it out loud,
        without feeling stupid.
    </p>

    <p>Try these desires now: “I want to be promiscuous”, “I want a nice house”, “I want to improve the world”, “I want
        to leave and impact”, “I want to be free”, “I want to disappear from the internet”, “I want …”</p>

    <p>Every one of these will reach a point, where they will sound stupid. Except for 1: “I want to be free”. Some
        desires will not disappear, no matter how hard you try: “I want to be enlightened”, “I want peace” and “I want
        to be free”. Those are your real, unfiltered desires, not propagated by external forces. Asses where any desire
        comes from. </p>

    <p>There is also a slight difference. Since every desire can be made to look stupid, you have to compare. “I want a
        stable job” and “I want to become an entrepreneur” can have different outputs for different people. But if you
        say: “I want to become an entrepreneur because I have seen something on social media it felt nice to watch”, you
        have saved yourself from a life that you would have regretted otherwise. You should consider looking at the
        problems next to the “reward” too, as this can significantly change your assessment. For example, “I want to be
        a blogger” and “I want to be a YouTuber” are similar in their output, money, and reach, but they are slightly
        different. </p>

    <p>Desires can be assessed this way, and so can beliefs and opinions. Similar technique. For example, “I belief it's
        too late to change my life”, “I belief I don't need to question my opinions”, “I belief I'm a winner/loser”, “I
        belief in free will” … </p>

    <p>As you can see, opinions/beliefs can be made look silly themselves, and also by looking at their origin. It's
        very important to see if you believe something yourself, or if something has been just planted into your mind. I
        won't bring examples because it gets dangerous here. What is actually confirmed by yourself, what is just
        common sense and what is something some random person has told you, who may be hostile to you? What desires
        originate from a hostile place like social media?</p>

    <p>You can avoid going too far if you try to assess whether other opinions match this. “AI will replace all jobs”,
        have you ever made AI yourself? “The world is going to get extinct by climate change by 2050”, have you ever
        recorded the weather, personally? “The gap between the rich and the poor is a huge problem”, have you ever seen
        both sides, personally?</p>


    <p>Another important fact to consider is the possibility of misleading desires. For example, do you want to have
        video surveillance in your own room with the government watching or the footage being broadcasted life into the
        internet? Maybe you think, this will give you pressure to stay disciplined. But in that case, it's not the video
        cameras that you desire, it's the discipline.</p>

    <p>It takes 1 night to question everything. This could be the most significant night of your life and you may not
        even remember it. Consider the cost of not reading this blog. You could be chasing the wrong things your whole
        life and only notice it at a point of no return. Don't be scared to delete your old desires or beliefs, because
        the earlier you do it, the better your life will be. “It's already too late” or “I don't need to question my
        desires and opinions” would be the first beliefs/opinion/desire to asses. Look where everything has come from,
        and where it leads to. </p>
