    <h1>Friendship</h1>
 
    <p><strong><em>They are not your friends.</em></strong> I don't know how many friends you have as of this instant,
        however, I guarantee the quantity is genuine friends is much lower than you assume. For most people, the number
        is a precise zero, and until recently, this number was zero for me as well. Before I skipped 9th grade, I had
        some “friends” or what you may call it. We were together in school and communicated together frequently. We
        would have lunch together in school and sometimes meet. Do you know what these friendships were missing?
        Genuineness. Just because you talk with each other doesn't mean you are friends. So, what do you think happened,
        when I went into 10th grade (I skipped 9th grade) and they went into 9th grade? Do you think we continued to
        spend time or do you think that I lost contact with them? The latter happened, and we lost contact. </p>

    <p>Most friend groups aren't actually friends, they just have a habit in common whether it be school, work, or
        parties, most of the time it's a bad habit. Often, they are friendly with each other in their presence, yet
        gossip and despise each other in their respective absence. There is a good chance they are talking badly of you
        if you aren't present. I'm guilty of it too, I may talk in school to some people regularly and call them losers
        simultaneously because we secretly simply don't like each other. However, I wouldn't ever talk to these people
        in the absence of a common interest and neither would you. As I skipped 9th grade, every “friend” of mine became
        redundant instantly because we had nothing in common. </p>

    <p><em>Most people live absolutely pathetic lives. Most people challenge themselves to live an invisible inauthentic
            meaningless life in quite desperation. They never get onto self-improvement and never even grasp how void
            their life is. </em></p>

    <p>Let me tell you something, which some parents would get mad for reading. My stepfather goes to my village's
        football team and has a decently high position there. Of course, there are other team members on this football
        team as well. Often, they meet to play football, to eat, to drink, and to celebrate. They have fun together and
        some are also friends outside of football, they gift each other things. They are telling each other jokes in a
        friendly atmosphere. After all, it's a community of like-minded people and communities are essential to form
        friends. This sounds very wholesome until you sit down with a piece of paper to grasp the essence. </p>

    <p>I mean, just think what unifies these people. Alcohol? Yes, exactly. If they never drank together, they would
        realize how uninteresting and inauthentic they all are. They wouldn't even consider spending time together if
        they didn't have their football. They don't really care about each other; I doubt that they are having deep
        talks about the meaning of life if sober. An idiot may point out that not every “friendship” in that football
        club is as inauthentic as I portrayed it to be right here; if the friendship was authentic, you wouldn't need
        football, football would be a great bonus. Friendship is not the people you spend time with and talk to, friends
        are people who care about - precisely - you with nothing in between. Don't mistake the need to be social for
        having friends, spending time with people implies no friendship.</p>

    <p>It's very easy to determine if someone is a real friend or not. Would you let them spend time with your children?
        Did they call you when you were sick?</p>

    <p>“Well, I don't think your friends are genuine” and that person responded with “We know that we all despise each
        other, we all know that we are only fake friends.” I'm talking about people who get offended if you remind them
        to sit upright and spend no less than 4 hours a day on the Internet. They know that they hate each other, yet do
        nothing. How can you live like that?</p>

    <p>This week, I was sick for 2 days and I got called by someone how I was doing. That's a real friend. </p>


    <p><strong><em>Breaking free from fake friends.</em></strong> It takes some courage to accept temporary solitude. It
        also takes some strength to break free, yet it's harder in your imagination than in reality. I must admit that I
        never needed to do that, because in my case everyone saw how much I changed because we had a countrywide curfew
        in 2020 and 2021. But often, change only starts after breaking free. It's only after you have changed your
        environment that you start to change - don't be friends with crabs. Here is the exact thing you can send.</p>

    <p><em>“Hey, [name], I know it may sound surprising to you but I have changed drastically and I think we should no
            longer be friends. I appreciated having spent time with you, yet it is time to move on.”</em></p>

    <p>Now it's time to get rid of a few self-limiting beliefs. First of all, you are thinking too highly of yourself.
        They won't keep thinking about you for long, you can trust me on this one. They will try to fight you from
        leaving i.e., crabs in a bucket, but that's temporary, only a few days - they still have other people. Secondly,
        what are they going to do against it? Thirdly, what could they write to bring you back? - Nothing is holding you
        back except your mind. The fourth self-limiting belief that you may possess is that they will be worse off
        without you and that you can be a force for the good, again you are thinking too much of yourself. Another
        self-limiting belief is that it's going to be awkward once you see them in person - that's only the case in your
        mind and only for 30 seconds for the rest of your life. Yes, being alone is scary, but necessary for
        development. Now, let's say you are in a situation where you are trying to break free from one group into the
        other. In that case, remember the outside perspective and the future perspective. The price of not shifting may
        be too expensive in the long run. Take a notebook, think everything through, and write down every self-limiting
        belief. </p>

    <p>The final self-limiting belief is that you can simply ignore them instead of cutting ties correctly. That's not
        possible, because the temptations are too great, and it's going to haunt you, it can haunt you for the rest of
        your life! I haven't cut ties properly with those from 8th grade to an extent I should have, that's why I urge
        you to! </p>

    <p>It takes zero willpower to get up, it takes zero willpower to sit down at the desk, it takes zero willpower to
        take a piece of paper, it takes zero willpower to take a pencil and it takes zero willpower to start writing
        down self-limiting beliefs until your mind is empty. </p>

    <p>If you don't break free, you will not be able to make progress correctly, because you need to change your
        environment to change yourself. After all, you want to have high-value friends. Sacrifice your old “friends”, be
        alone for a while, and build yourself up - that's what it takes.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Saving the doomed.</em></strong> This is a concept I've explained in an old text of mine and it
        applies specifically to being “friends” with people far below you, people who never got onto self-improvement
        and drag others down. It doesn't make sense morally, emotionally, or rationally to do so. The doomed are
        responsible for their situation, that's why it won't bring anything to attempt to fix them. That's why it's
        impossible to break free from digital addiction if you don't consider it to be a problem to begin with. </p>

    <p><em>“Losers make up the majority of people. They never did anything heroic, remarkable, meaningful, or
            interesting. Life is extremely giving. Let's say one was a loser in primary school. One still has the chance
            to better themselves in the gymnasium. If one is still a loser, one can still make the Abitur (German school
            diploma) even after one has left school. If one is still a loser, one still has the chance to get a higher
            education for free in Germany. But still, losers fail at everything they do or simply don't achieve anything
            remarkable. They constantly complain, are ungrateful, and blame others rather than taking radical
            responsibility. Worst of all, they drag down others and the people threatening their excuses. It's easy to
            become a loser, and hard to be upright. Losers are so weak, that they don't even try. Losers pick the wrong
            environment. They simply fail at everything and have still expectations, but most of them don't even try.
            Losers can't resist pleasure. […] You may feel the moral obligation to help losers, especially if you have
            known them for a long time. But losers don't want to be helped. There is also something disgusting and
            narcissistic about helping people who don't want your help. You are positioning yourself as the hero and
            lifting yourself up, regardless of whether you are doing it intentionally or subconsciously. You will feel
            great after trying to help a loser. Let me put it this way. Being in prison is an unpleasant situation, do
            you feel obligated to help a prisoner? No, why not? Because the prisoner is responsible for his situation.
            Why do you assume that the loser is innocent and not responsible himself? It's easy to think that the
            environment and certain events in life play a crucial role. They do, but you are still in control. You
            choose your environment and you certainly have an impact on your own life. Just because losers blame others,
            doesn't mean it's not their fault. Why do you think, the age of criminal responsibility is, in most
            countries, 12 years? Only spend time with people who want to elevate you, and consume content that elevates
            you.” - blog 28</em></p>


    <p><strong><em>An obvious red flag, on the metaphysics of relations.</em></strong> If you were to meet me in real
        life without ever having watched self-improvement content, you would find me very out of place. Why do you think
        that is? Because you are the average of the people you spend the most time with, regardless of whether you want
        it or not. That's why it's impossible to fully respect someone if you see their friends and it can add respect
        if you see their high-status friends. If you spend time with people, it means you are similar to them. If that
        doesn't apply and you happen to be far ahead, the previous problems of “saving the doomed” apply and you would
        be better off spending time with people with your best interest at heart.</p>

    <p>The same applies to the content they consume, if they watch trash, they are trash. Makeup lifestyle videos will
        transform you into a shallow person. I watch and read precisely what I write about. So, you don't have to spend
        time with people to be shaped by them, their content is already enough. After all, the content you consume
        shapes you and so do the people you spend time with. The opposite applies as well, you shape the content you're
        consuming and the people spending time with you. You shape others and others shape you, that's called the
        looking-glass self. If you think to are a loser, others are going to treat you accordingly, manifesting the
        impression eventually. If you think you're a winner, even if you aren't one, others are going to treat you as
        such, even if only very subtle, yet this starts a positive feedback loop. Hence, it's vital to have an upright
        posture! </p>

    <p>Others can also shape you, even if they aren't present, with the help of their content, because the content you
        are consuming becomes your reality for this moment and wires your brain accordingly. For instance, if you read
        texts by Immanuel Kant, you are going to become moral, automatically. If you watch degenerates, you are going to
        become a degenerate yourself. Hence, it's vital to control the flow of information, whether it be in the realm
        of thoughts or in person.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Stop networking.</em></strong> . Perhaps, you think that personal networks are of value. Let me
        promise, in the first few years you will make more progress on your own, because if you network, you won't be
        able to work together with people way above you anyway, if 2 losers are connected, you have 2 connected losers
        and nothing more. Only after you become decently successful, you may consider networking. Don't mistake getting
        someone's phone number for being friends with them or them being useful to you. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Women aren't funny.</em></strong> . In real life, a lot of people dislike the idea that men and women
        can't be friends in the classical sense. Of course, they can be, but only in the case where they are similar. -
        Here is where the problem lies, because normally, men and women are opposites. An extremely feminine woman and
        an extremely masculine man can't be friends. Complementary opposites tend to attract each other.</p>

    <p>I'm extremely masculine, so for me, it's not possible to be “friends” with women. Friends have to have something
        in common, yet the only thing that ultra-masculine/feminine people have in common is love. Well, you may not
        know what being extremely masculine means. It means that when you shower warm, you start to suffer, it means
        that everything except for productivity feels terrible. In the last 365 days, I went to the cinema once, that
        was in December 2022 and I went because my mother dragged me there to “spend some time with my family.” I wasted
        90 minutes on the movie and 30 minutes getting ready, walking, and so on. Afterward, I needed 2 hours to recover
        from all that mind-numbing stimulation. Here is another example. As previously mentioned in a text, I suffered
        more in October 2023 because I ate sweets than I did after getting rejected by a girl in June 2023, because I
        had extreme discipline at that time. Unfortunately, no one understands this except for spiritual teachers.
        Everyone I know in person doesn't want to accept that the life they are trying to convince me of is inauthentic.
        Resting, sweets, … they are all nonsense. Even Nietzsche said: “I know of no better life purpose than to perish
        in attempting the great and the impossible” You see, this quote doesn't say: “Well, once a week, go to the
        cinema” It seems too crazy to say “I suffered more by eating a piece of cake than to get rejected by the
        'perfect' girl” - I know what's going to happen. My grandmother is going to read this passage and will say that
        I write nonsense because after all, cold water is unhealthy and you need both hot and cold water. Well, I've
        listened to your advice and suffered hard because of it! It doesn't work for me to rest, there is only work and
        sleep, and everything else creates intense misery. Most people have zero idea of what masculine and feminine
        even mean, my sister said that writing is somehow a female trait!</p>

    <p>My blog is 130,000 words and zero of them are “girlfriend.” For me, it's impossible to just be friends, if you
        love each other. Do you think a person like me would “go to a café and then to the cinema” once in a
        relationship? The common thing is love and not something like cinema that you would do with normal friends or
        even fake ones. Otherwise, you will ruin the relationship in the long run. The term girlfriend implies that you
        have a lot in common, meaning that you are friends with a little extra, but that's fundamentally a flawed
        concept since you are each other's complementary opposite. Opposite, not similar. Let me put it differently. Do
        you consider talking about the political and economic state of the world with your future wife? No, because she
        absolutely won't care about the political and economic state of the world. If you want to philosophize about the
        essence of the world, you need male friends. While reading my blogs, you likely noticed that I use the terms
        love, future wife, the one, her, or she instead of girlfriend.</p>

    <p>Now you may be tempted to think that she may want to go to the cinema with you. Well, that's a test to verify
        your integrity. She will lose respect for you if she knows how much you dislike cinemas and still go, despite
        her being joyful about it temporarily, but you don't pursue temporary things anyway, do you? Every couple that
        spends time outside of loving time spends too much time together and this makes relationships break apart
        because you will get bored of each other. If the relationship doesn't break apart, another consequence can
        happen if you spend too much time together as friends would: the dynamic gets ruined and becomes a mother-son
        one instead of a father-daughter. Do you want this to happen, because you saw your girl as a friend? And yes,
        this needs to be set straight, women aren't funny. It's very exhausting to spend a lot of time in general,
        regardless of whether you love them or not.</p>

    <p>There are 3 kinds of love, Eros, romantic love, Philia, the love towards friends and family, and there is Agape,
        unconditional love towards God. Don't mix them up, otherwise, your life will be incomplete. Women are for love,
        not to be friends with. </p>

    <p><strong><em>My children, I love you, yet we aren't friends either.</em></strong> Similarly, parents can't be
        friends with their children, otherwise, they will develop in a messed-up way. Your role as a parent is to
        socialize with your children and to discipline them. You must teach them morals, I certainly won't shortcut this
        step ;-) Then, you must set examples of how to live right and be an example, a disciplined one. You must teach
        children how to handle their freedom to set them up. You see, that's not what you would typically do with your
        friends. Your friends and you are equals, yet the parent is a teacher. Teaching children how to be moral doesn't
        include going to the cinema either.</p>


    <p><strong><em>Keep your circle small and your influence large.</em></strong> Just like with most things in life,
        you need to subtract the things holding you back. For example, let go of digital addiction or fake friends. You
        don't need many real friends, because it's better to have a select few real friends then it is to have a hundred
        fake ones. Sure, keep your influence large by being friendly to a lot of people, but remember not to mistake
        them for real friends. </p>

    <p><strong><em>See, what they took from you.</em></strong>Perhaps most of your problems are caused by too much
        societal damage created by the internet, social media, and a meta-capitalist society. Perhaps you have almost
        nonexistent social skills, a destroyed attention span, a broken personality, and too little time for genuine
        friends. You already know 'subconsciously' that most of your problems are caused by the internet and the immense
        damage it does. Other parts of society are hostile to the development of real friends. For example, communities
        get shattered by capitalism, always chasing newer jobs and moving around frequently. It often robs the time it
        takes to form real friends. Also, atheism destroyed societal bonds, regardless of your opinion on religion.
        Urban life is terrible for social lives as well. This meta-capitalist system also broke the importance of
        families with its hostile flow of information. They took from your genuine friendships and relations and
        replaced them with a disposable form of it using social media.</p>

    <p>It's your responsibility to fix that. You are in control.</p>

    <p>You are in control and you will make progress and fix every problem. You will find amazing friends, and even
        better if you see them frequently in person rather than online. It's phenomenal to have friends you can trust
        and you should be striving towards that, unless you need to build up yourself first. </p>

    <p>How do you know if someone is trustworthy? Well, they are authentic. They don't try to change you, and they have
        their lives in perfect order. </p>

    <p>How do you find better friends? It's by being a better friend yourself. Call that person and ask how he is doing.
        Be trustworthy, authentic, and humble, don't try to change others, and have your life in perfect order. Don't be
        complicated or arrogant. There are great people everywhere once you leave your room, if you build yourself up.
        In friendship, similar people attract each other, hence be a good friend to have good friends.</p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

    <p>Miss K., thank you for the inspiration. Otherwise, I would have never written this text. I do acknowledge, that
        many things were granted to be obvious in the section “Women aren't funny,” so that means there are a few
        potential texts that can be written about it. Both about the essence of relationships and about the essence of
        an ultra-masculine/feminine life. Most people know nothing about it, they have never heard of concepts like
        polarization (~desire for each other), or attachment styles and don't know what relationships are for in the
        first place. Most people also know or have never experienced what it's like to be extremely feminine/masculine.
        <br><br> I hope, by now everyone
        understood how much I dislike going to the cinema ;-)
