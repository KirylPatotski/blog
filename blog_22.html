        content="Life is a product of countless decisions, some insignificant, others life-changing. Three pivotal moments shaped my journey: the desire to become an entrepreneur, sparked by a family conversation; a YouTube copyright block, leading me to cinematic videos; and doubts about science after an internship. Making decisions means focusing on a chosen path while eliminating alternatives. In June 2023, intense productivity led to burnout, impacting creativity. A short story about sacrifice further influenced my direction. Many events continue to shape my life and yours, their significance often realized later, free from surrounding noise, revealing their true impact.">

    <h1>How single moments change your life forever</h1>

    <p>Most of the time nothing is truly random and your destination in life is a result of a million decisions. The
        vast majority of these decisions are so trivial or small that they don't even occupy your conscious mind as you
        make them. But some moments and their resulting decisions are capable of changing your life forever, sometimes
        giving it a 180° turn. These moments will be remembered for the rest of your life, sometimes you'll only find
        them in retrospect while looking back and reflecting. </p>

    <p>My story is shaped by 3 single moments changing my life abruptly by a single decision with a long-lasting impact.
    </p>

    <p>At the end of 2020, I was 13 years old and started to learn how to code, since I knew that I wanted to become an
        entrepreneur. This was the result of a single conversation happening between me and my family. This is, so to
        speak, a single moment that changed my life forever, but my desire to become an entrepreneur already existed at
        that time and just got uncovered, so it did not create a 180° turn. I did start to learn how to code, but I
        knew, even at the age of 13, that to become successful in the modern age I would need to create content. In my
        burnout phase, where I tried hard to learn how to code in the spring of 2021, I started to pay attention to
        YouTube for the first time. I tried so many different things. My first video was uploaded in May 2021 and was
        about Windows shortcuts. I tried my informative videos, mostly about data safety, and got my first real video
        editing software to enhance my videos. As a result, I created 2 videos, the first one about data and bits
        (~4:30), and the second one was originally intended as a presentation for geography, it was about China's
        economic development (~8:00). I uploaded it to YouTube and it got blocked (!) because of copyright. I had no
        idea what copyright was or how it worked at that time. That killed every imagination I had in an instant; I
        could not create informative videos. But as a result of the creation of this video, I came across a YouTube
        called 22zweizwei, which created time-lapses. I watched a single video, which lasted 2 minutes. It's called
        “Minsk, city of sun…” This video impressed me so much, as I have lived in Minsk for the first 5 years of my
        life. I knew from that point on, that creating cinematic videos will be my new hobby. I had no hardware to
        create time-lapses at all, I took my phone on a tripod like an idiot and got started right away. My first
        timelapse was uploaded in July 2021. But the impact of these 2 minutes lasted much longer. Because the China
        info video got blocked, I was uncertain whether I should be creating YouTube at all. I saw this timelapse and
        everything became certain. This decision resulted in me creating a bunch of videos and getting the confidence to
        create my current YouTube channel, because of the success of my timelapse videos, in the spring of 2022 when I
        started to upload individual clips as YouTube shorts. Ironically, as I wrote the first 400 words of this text,
        my computer was rendering a timelapse, Barcelona. </p>

    <p>There is another time when my life changed around 1 year later. While I was certain about my entrepreneurial
        journey in 2020, I got big doubts about it in 2022, because I was unsure as I expected to become a scientist for
        almost my entire life. Because in the winter of 2022, I started developing simple “research papers”, with some
        noteworthy examples: 2 new algorithms to generate random numbers. I made an internship in my local university.
        While I did enjoy it, and it certainly challenged me, on 1.7.2022 there was an open-door day in the evening. I
        liked it. But, as I got home, my whole world collapsed, again. I knew that the life of a researcher is not the
        right way of life for me. From that on I started to focus entirely on my entrepreneurial journey, now with more
        certainty. </p>

    <p>What does it mean, to decide? Making a decision means focusing on and cutting out alternatives. Now, I had
        removed alternatives.</p>

    <p>June 2023 was a wild month for me. As discussed in the previous essays several obstacles started to build up.
        Since I have increased my productivity with lifestyle changes, such as getting up at 5 or going to the gym, with
        ChatGPT I could get a lot of work done. Also, I had no distractions and a very high baseline of stress tolerance
        and I had an aim. Everything looked perfect, and it was for a solid 2 months. But, with such immense
        productivity and focus as well as competence I started to work so hard, that I got into a situation where around
        50 failures accumulated - I couldn't handle it. Also, my creativity started to decline as a result. My hard work
        phase of the last 2.5 years ended, and there was no return. On June 2nd, 2023, someone sent me a short story. It
        was about the sacrifice for later, my way of life then, and what problems it created. That killed my
        uninterrupted work days with an impact I have not fully understood now.</p>

    <p>I guess, many more single events changed my life, and many more that changed yours. But often you only realize
        the significance of an event many years later, then when you have deleted all the noise surrounding these
        magical moments and just remember the significance.</p>
