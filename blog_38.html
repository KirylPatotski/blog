    <h1>No way around YouTube</h1>

    <p>As you I have mentioned in my previous blogs, I have been creating YouTube videos for a long time, since 2021.
        Currently, I have 2 YouTube channels¹ but the second one fills my whole life, that's why there is no way around
        it.</p>

    <p>Because YouTube is central to my life, I have a hard time stating to explain the effect it had on my life so far.
        But what I can tell, these blogs, my apps, and my YouTube channels are not random, I set myself a frame for that
        already in 2020 when I was 13, unfortunately, this document is lost, but I do remember it in detail since I'm
        living in accordance to it. I first started with YouTube in 2021 and the first thing that YouTube did is relieve
        my burnout caused by programming too much, now I had a second thing to work on. I learned how to edit and record
        timelapses and other videos, and am still learning. It gave me confidence by giving me half a million views in
        2022, again filling the gap between my programming course and the start of the development of my apps. But the
        next try, starting in March 2023 would change everything forever. On the day I started to record YouTube I held
        my room in perfect order ever since, especially my desk. But the effect was even larger on my appearance. I have
        not started with YouTube earlier because of my acne and my stutters. But since then, I started to dress properly
        and to make my hair. My mother even started to suspect that I may have a woman (or multiple) since I started doing this,
        and this was not <em>too</em> far off. (The context suggests that I see YouTube as my love: I don't see
        YouTube,
        since YouTube is an abstract concept, I view YouTube as a machine, just
        what it really is) In every video I would improve my confidence, appearance, content, and speech, all very
        powerful things. For example, storytelling and expressing thoughts is a skill I lacked. Complex thoughts were
        also non-existent. But as I wrote 120 pages worth of content, that is 40 000 words², and I have almost perfected
        that. It also made it easier for me to write these blogs, containing additional 26 000 words as I write this
        text. It's not just the writing, storytelling, argumentation, structuring, and expression that got better, it's
        the process of thinking. I have faced a lot of challenges in overcoming my awkwardness around the camera as well
        as my speech. All of these skills are very universal throughout life, which means, YouTube is like a testing
        ground for life itself.</p>

    <p>I did not expect to learn that much from creating YouTube videos. But still, I learned a lot more than I expected
        and still continue to learn. Other skills that content creation improves are communication and marketing. You
        should not forget why you started. I started because I needed to think long-term (Read the blog <a
            href="blog_6.html">"The only way to
            live”</a>) and I needed influence, reach, and a good and trusting audience, otherwise, I would not be able
        to
        promote my apps or this blog, for example. Don't forget where you come from and where you go, don't look away
        from your vision. </p>

    <p>Even more important than all the skills that YouTube taught me, are the experiences. One of my first YouTube
        videos created on my second YouTube channel, which is the one from March 2023, was on how to be creative. This
        single video changed my own life forever because I am a representation of what I teach, that's what I needed to
        prove. So, I came up with 35 video ideas in 7 minutes. Later, I would refine all those ideas and gain even more
        ideas. That was the best time of my life and also lead to a catastrophic <a href="blog_19.html">burnout</a> in June 2023. </p>

    <p>¹ Comment: In “Stay away from me” I claimed that how you do one thing is how you do everything, but I think that
        applies to negative traits rather than the work you do, but the fact that I mention it makes it a lot more
        cursed. So, I can invest time in 2 YouTube channels, because in parallel I also have many other projects as
        well, such as my apps. </p>

    <p>²Comment: I would go insane if I counted it. Rather it is an estimate. I have filled 58 (diary) + 90 pages
        (notebook) + 5 pages (text on a computer), if one page contains 200 words, that's 40 000 words. The math doesn't
        work out that well, because not every page is filled 100%.</p>
