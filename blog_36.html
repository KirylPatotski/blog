    <h1>Golden insecurities</h1>

    <p>When I used to be a loser, with no purpose, mission, goal, or desire, that was before I was 13, in 2020, I used
        to have constant thoughts that are unthinkable now. I used to think that everyone hates me, that I am awkward,
        that I am not trying hard enough, that I am a failure, that time is running out, and that the future is coming
        with great uncertainty. I used to have dark thoughts and insecurities before going to bed and when waking up. As
        a 13-year-old, I drowned in consumerism and constant stimulation. Somehow, I managed to get rid of everything,
        of every dark, insecure thought and of any bad habit. I managed to break free from materialism and constant
        stimulation. </p>

    <p>First of all, let's assess your insecurities. (read the text <a href="blog_33.html">"Desires"</a> if you haven't,
        this is basically part 2)
        What are insecurities and stress actually? The answers are fairly simple. </p>

    <p>Let me tell you a story, and how I have a stress level of zero. In March 2023 I got permitted to create an
        extensive paper, about my entrepreneurial journey, which will be a replacement for an exam, and between 15 and
        35 pages long. I wrote the first 25 pages in 2 days. That's 7000 words. Now, for months this paper got removed
        from my mind, and only recently it has gotten back, like a stressful, dark thought. That's because I knew that I
        had to finish it since now would be the best opportunity to do so. That's the reason stress is useful in the
        first place because it reminds you of an event or thing that you procrastinated with and needs to be done, even
        though long-term stress can be detrimental, especially if you don't address it. Now, today I started to work on
        this paper again, and the stress did not go away, because I'm not done now. </p>

    <p>Enjoy your insecurities, because you may never have them again. They show you what's wrong with you, rather than
        what event or thing you have been procrastinating with and you will fix that, I believe in you! For example, an
        insecurity that you may have, is you being a loser, just as I did. Guess what, if you stop being a loser these
        insecurities will simply go away, that's the reason you may enjoy them now, because they will go away forever!
        If you try everything as hard as you can, to put it simply, you will have no time to be insecure, and all stress
        and insecurities will simply fade and get replaced with new, weaker ones. Now I have not reached a point of
        total peace of mind or security, but I am certain that I will reach this point in about a month because I am
        fairly close to it.</p>


    <p>There is no way back because insecurities are the thing that rob you the most of your life quality because they
        show you where you have messed up. Your dark thoughts will chase you until you take action and they will chase
        you all of the time. Life gets so much worse with insecurities, and so much better without. Visualize yourself
        at night. Do you want to have dark or uplifting thoughts there? No, because they are terrible. </p>

    <p>An effective way to stop having dark thoughts is to have high and strong standards. Standards are fundamental in
        everyone and everything. Imagine, if there were no standards, you wouldn't even dare to enter a car. Regulations
        and high standards for safety, for example, are basically the same thing. Because someone messed up in the
        future, laws are passed to prevent catastrophes from happening again. Standards allow you to say “no” and “I
        have had enough”. You can say, “I have had enough of worrying about this or that, now it's time to change”.
        Because, just like regulations, this will prevent you from messing up. For example, I used to meditate 2 times a
        day, but since I went to Spain for 2 weeks, I got out of this habit, so I messed up and said to myself: “never
        again” </p>
