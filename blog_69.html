    <h1>My first enounter with stagnation</h1>

    <p>I ordered my first camera in September of 2021, back then I had already been creating YouTube videos for a while
        and was excited to create my 4th timelapse video, the trip to Leipzig in the October holidays. I waited… and
        waited… for 6 months until February 2022. </p>

    <p>Of course, when you get a new camera, you start to regret buying it, because the photos and videos will turn out
        worse than expected. But slowly, you start to fall in love with it because you find out how to use the camera
        properly to excel. This took a while and I think, I still haven't discovered the camera's full potential. I use
        this camera to record all my videos, cinematic, time-lapses, and normal videos as well. The camera had also the
        capability to record slow motions.</p>

    <p>After my programming course ended, in April of 2022 I got tired of programming, <em>”I have had enough”</em> and last
        April week published a video: “Spring timelapse 2022”, my best video at the time. A new idea struck me: I could
        upload the individual timelapse clips as shorts and gain massive traction with little additional effort. I would
        simply have to export them individually and add some music and could use my archive of ~1000 clips from the
        previous 11 months. The perfect idea on the surface. </p>

    <p>Even though I portray my past to be full of bad habits, it doesn't mean I couldn't be productive, as the bad
        habits, (ironically) YouTube shorts only occupied the unproductive hours of the evening and in the noon
        performance low. I got started almost right away and I the first as the first video, one where I put my camera
        on a rotating 1-hour alarm clock and got 300 views I was hooked. Soon, more and more followed. Then, I started
        to innovate, with more ideas, and more concepts, I started to create slow motions, experiments, more timelapses…
        My best videos were the ones where I dropped colorful water against the low-standing sun in slow motion, the
        videos where I would drop things and let them shatter, and the ones where water was flowing in slow motion.
        While the education of the videos was zero, creating them was still valuable and fun for me, as it bridged the
        time between the programming course and the development of my first app. I had consequently nothing to do and
        uploaded 5-10 videos a day consistently. But, eventually, I gave up, after the 375th video and the 884th
        subscriber, and 650 000 views, and I realized that things didn't go in my favor.</p>

    <p>Some motivational videos would have told you to never give up and to stay consistent. My friend, 375 tries over
        the span of roughly 1 month is consistent enough. The concept just didn't work. As I started, I thought ideas
        would keep flowing in and they did, but most of the ideas except the dominant 3 failed. I finally quit creating
        these shorts one week after I published my Hamburg timelapse. I saw it already coming after the trip in May,
        right in the middle between late April and early June, I began to stagnate. Constantly, ideas kept coming in,
        and I innovated, jet little progress happened. My videos got consistently over 1,500 views, but no more.
        Something was fundamentally wrong. As I started to stagnate, my creativity dropped, and so did my determination,
        drive, willpower, fun, and diligence. I lost. </p>

    <p>How do you differentiate between stagnation and missing results? It's simple. From experience, I can tell that
        missing results don't equal stagnation, but if you see some results and these results remain the same, even with
        new ideas and improvements. The whole idea was set up to fail from the initial moment and you didn't know it.
        You were exclusively seeing results because of your effort rather than the concept itself. Because you decide
        how much effort you put into something, the results are directly tied to your effort. However, a good idea with
        the right amount of effort must yield compounding results. Otherwise, you are stagnating.</p>

    <p>How do you find out, when to give up? There is a saying that goes “Success comes just one step after giving up”
        and it is true for <em>revolutionary concepts</em>, not for your YouTube channel. Frankly, I don't have enough
        experience to provide an outline for the invested effort and when it shows stagnation.</p>

    <h1>How I could have delayed it</h1>

    <p>Yes, I admit I failed very fast with my first real YouTube effort and that's okay, it gave me <em>confidence</em> for
        future YouTube channels as the most important result. But would it have made sense to post slower to give the
        YouTube algorithm more time to process it and find a higher audience? Would it make more sense to slow down to
        get even more innovative? - If, if, if… It doesn't matter. I was seeing results independent of how fast I was
        going. I could have posted 1 or 100 videos per day and still gotten low results, as those were tied to my effort
        rather than the concept, so moving slower would have just delayed everything, and consumed more of my mental
        capacity. For nothing.</p>

    <h1>How I know I lost <a href="blog_64.html">“The Final Battle”</a>?</h1>

    <p>Here is a summary of the text “The Final Battle”: I developed competence and further built it, created a few apps
        as a result, and saw no results. Then I decided to finally test the idea, my first app, by advertising for it
        for the last time. Yes, I did get around 300 downloads, so I was seeing results for the effort I put in. But for
        which effort? For the advertising, not for the app itself. If the concept was great, people would be sharing it
        and therefore my growth would continue after I stopped advertising. This never happened. </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Stagnation is the process that rewards your effort rather than your idea. It is marked by not compounding
        results, not nonexistent once.</p>

        <h1>Why things need to grow</h1>

        <p>What's the difference, between a 500-year-old house no one cared about and a 500-year-old tree no one cared about? The house was built on effort the tree on growth. The tree blossoms even after 500 years while the house is in complete ruins. Growth is the counter force to mistakes and makes them even and insignificant again, therefore an effort-based is unsustainable, as it will always require effort and never yield growth on its own. If something constantly requires your effort, time, and energy, it robs you of freedom, rather than giving you freedom, like the tree, which grows on its own rather than the house that needs your maintenance. Life is defined as the fight against the universe's indifference, the state of least resistance, do you want your ideas to be dead, or alive and blossoming? </p>
