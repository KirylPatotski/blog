    <h1>Resting?</h1>

    <p>My relation to resting and rewarding myself has always been a difficult one. <em>Maybe our personalities simply
            aren't compatible.</em> Anyway, here is a brief story. </p>

    <p>1. Phase I - Hyperfocus</p>

    <p>As I started to learn how to program at the end of 2020 and at the age of 13, I had nothing else to do, was dull,
        incompetent, and slow, as I had no expertise, however, I did possess time. These are excellent starting
        conditions for hyperfocus, a phase where you focus on only one thing. There are many things playing against you
        in this phase, as you most likely still have an abundance of bad habits. Moving forward is also slow, as you are
        doing things for the first time. After living in this phase I learned the basics of programming, but I burned
        out in the spring of 2021 already, as I got tired of programming. </p>

    <p>2. Phase II - Variety is a must</p>

    <p>Then, I started to incorporate a variety of tasks, such as content creation as well, so that my days would get
        some kind of variety to prevent burnout again. This phase lasted around 2 years, from June 2021 to June 2022. In
        this phase my productivity saw never before accessed levels of productivity, as I removed any bad habits, and
        distractions and fixed my life. At the same time, I started to work more effectively, as I became more
        experienced and knowledgeable. This phase is my favorite because it feels good to give everything for 2 years in
        a row without ever resting and gaining more knowledge and results in the process. I focused both on YouTube and
        on programming, luckily, these areas didn't interfere, and this allowed me to use one task to rest from another
        one. I saw enormous creativity and productivity too, as this was suppressed by incompetence and missing
        lifestyle changes previously. I did more and more… </p>

    <p>Until I burned out again in June of 2023. I was absolutely worth it, and I did the right thing. I simply did
        something and got smart in the process, it didn't matter that it was “unsustainable” because this specific
        scenario would never happen again anyway, and it was better to be <em>fast</em>, delaying it would be
        emotionally and
        time-wise very painful and expensive. I moved from “more” to “better” in the process. </p>

    <p>10 days of burnout was the price of 2 years of uninterrupted performance. That's a good trade in my opinion.</p>

    <p>3. Phase III - Constant high performance </p>

    <p>And now I am in the phase where I am able to perform exceptionally, and constantly. Now I reached a level of
        competence, where I can differentiate between useless tasks and useful tasks. That's why now I'm able to afford
        to reward myself occasionally or to rest, as now I have reached a stage I could sustain for the rest of my life.
    </p>

    <p>Nonetheless, I should mention, I still don't go to parties, don't drink or smoke, have “free time” or don't eat
        unhealthy food. I think the concept of resting and rewarding yourself is corrupted by instant gratification.</p>

    <p>In the last days of the summer holidays, my mother bought me a pizza, because she knew I loved them. I refused to
        eat it, I said: “That's too expensive for me” You see, rewarding yourself doesn't mean harming yourself while
        having fun. Rewarding yourself and resting must be something sustainable, positive, and perhaps even boring.
        Work has to be interesting instead. You
        must go for a walk to reward yourself and not do something that harms you. Please don't mistake self-harm for
        rewarding yourself. Eating unhealthy food feels good for a few seconds while eating and terrible for the time
        before and after. A walk feels good sustainably, if it should cross a pizzeria, enjoy the smell.</p>

    <p>It's easy to say 1 pizza to your birthday celebration won't harm you. Sure, but why don't you take drugs then?
        Because the negative effects are instant, an overdose can kill within hours and the probability isn't low
        either. That's why it becomes obvious why you don't take drugs, the dangers are much faster, closer, and bigger.
        Yet, eating unhealthy compounds, and kills in the long run.</p>

    <p>I have noticed the harm of overstimulation, e.g. by going to the cinema. If you have a creative block,
        stimulating yourself will make it worse. The only way to get over a creative block is to focus on something
        different or to stare at your ceiling. Yesterday I got sick and didn't feel like writing anything, so after I
        came home from school I stared at my ceiling for a few hours. It helped. Boredom accelerates, not bad habits.
    </p>

    <p>Eating unhealthy or other bad, but “rewarding” activities are more costly than you think. It's the mental
        capacity you sacrifice and the time before and after that is wasted. A movie may last 90 minutes, yet getting to
        the cinema, waiting, buying the tickets, watching the film, and leaving, take closer to 3 hours. After you have
        numbed your mind, you will be unable to work for the next 4 hours. Altogether, 7 hours have been just wasted. To
        contrast this, a walk takes 2 hours and starts the second you get out of your room, after the walk, you may rest
        for 10 minutes and get increased productivity afterward.</p>

    <p>The concept of free time has been corrupted as well, there shouldn't be free time in the traditional sense. There
        is either intense work or intense rest, no passive state of consumption or bad habits. “Work hard, play hard”
    </p>

    <p>There are better ways to rest or to reward yourself, for example, sports, walking, meditation, physical labor,
        writing, going to events to learn something, reading, cleaning, or the most sustainable: boredom. That's exactly
        what I did during the peak of my burnout. I started at the ceiling. If you want to specifically reward yourself,
         light a candle and take a bath. </p>


    <p>4. Phase IV - Voluntary burnout</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes everything else fails even if you implement everything else. Here is a guide on what to do in that
        case.</p>

    <p>For the next few weeks or months, dispose of anything spiking the motivation neurotransmitter dopamine or
        anything constituting excessive comfort. Get rid of sweets, fruits, berries, sugar, dark chocolate, tea, warm
        water, music, light, books, reading, WhatsApp, YouTube videos, and any form of pleasure, stimulation, or input
        in general. You need to combine this with discipline only seen in prisons or the military. Absolute discipline
        will help to rest your mind properly, it will help to resist temptations. This period of your life will reset
        your baseline again and make you better in the long run, as this phase is extreme rest. You will allow your mind
        to sort everything out. I have done that already multiple times, a 2-week period with no input and absolute
        discipline will create around 3 months of peak performance.</p>
