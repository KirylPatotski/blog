    <h1>The sublime</h1>

    <p>Being alive is the strangest experience you can have. Thinking - why the hell is there a voice in one's head?
        What did one think thirty seconds ago, one does not know. Well, if one does not know, who's thinking in the
        first place? </p>

    <p><em><strong>The sublime is the edge.</strong></em> It's not particularly challenging to let depression dominate
        one's mind and neither is living a life in excessive comfort difficulty. Three meals a day. Warm water. Warm
        bed. Internet access. Car. Music. … Expanding the edge is difficult but rewarding. The sublime is precisely the
        edge of one's existence. It does not only break convention; it is the embodiment thereof. Every individual in
        every society knows what is accepted and what is not. The people you are surrounded by, moral laws, religion,
        science, art, literature and culture, job, and family all shape who you are as a person and what is acceptable.
        This circle evolves constantly, we have a different one to those ten thousand years ago. However, there is one
        thing that is as permanent as the heaven above earth, we are nevertheless conscious and there is always a
        horizon in the field of view, no matter where you look. Here; that's where we find the sublime. If you lean just
        beyond what is conventional and expected. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Hunger as a sublime experience.</strong></em> Do you know what it feels like to eat nothing for
        eighteen or twenty-four hours? Perhaps not, because your circle does not include it, though, if you are stressed
        enough, yes, most likely you do. But do you know what happens to your body and especially your mind when you do
        it at regular intervals? There are some positive effects, such as an increased lifespan paired with higher
        health and better well-being. The effects on the body are insignificant in comparison to those on the mind. When
        you deeply fast, you feel a desire too strong to resist with the fancy name of 'just-doing -things.' In every
        spiritual text, which are all highly sublime, there is somewhere an element of hunger and fasting. One of the
        most accurate books on human nature and spirituality ever created is the bible and here is a story; Jesus
        starves for forty days in the desert and refuses to turn a stone into a loaf of bread after Satan tempts him to.
        Jesus refused to trade earthly pleasures for spiritual ones, thus symbolically refusing to revoke humans of
        their free will and consciousness, that which separates humans from animals and lifeless matter. What
        transcending greatness can exist in the absence of life that transcends the spiritual and material? </p>

    <p><em><strong>February 3rd, 2024. A sublime experience.</strong></em> On the weekend I've been to a larger city in
        Germany, Leipzig - three hours away by train from where I live. After a night's sleep in a hostel, my sister and
        I ate some breakfast in the morning and it was eight o'clock. I knew that I was already used to hunger, so I
        removed the possibility of 'going to the store' to buy some food. From eight o'clock to fourteen o'clock I've
        already been walking through Leipzig by foot with my ten-kilo backpack, if I hadn't trained like a beast, it
        would have been very tenacious and exhausting. While walking, I looked at the buildings and sensed an undeniable
        grey dystopian depressive tone. Monotony everywhere. There was trash everywhere, sand with gravel just lying
        around, run-down panel buildings with unaesthetic and brutal design, disgusting shrill street art, derelicts,
        and the trees had no leaves, just as usual in the winter. The sky was desolately grey, not once was there a
        zestful blue spot anywhere. I walked perpetually through the city and it was so ugly that my thoughts were
        terrible and I didn't want to inhibit them or wasn't too. I chose to let the environment dictate my thoughts. I
        did not take many great photos; I worried I might have too few photos to then publish them. The thoughts kept
        getting darker and I did nothing. But then, slowly, after having strolled for breakless six hours something
        interesting happened, which I knew quite well and waited for. If you don't eat and drink for six hours and
        wander around, all negative thoughts disappear from one moment to the other. Now I was filled with life again, I
        was in a flow and outside of what is usual, on the border thereof. I was exhausted from wandering, yet refused
        to sit down as life is not meant to be lived in paralyzing weakness. It's only when you put yourself in this
        discomfort that authentic life starts, one where you wake up - when you are in discomfort you become fully
        conscious again, thus, every negative thought disappears, no matter if you coincidentally got your heart broken
        a few days prior and walked across perpetual ugliness. Discomfort is between danger and safety, between life and
        death, and between order and chaos, thus it is inherently sublime. Those moments of exhaustion are magical, you
        know that you were close to your edge and leaned just beyond it. No matter the external circumstances, you start
        to enter a sweet bliss. The sublime. Open your eyes. Being alive is strange. Suddenly, I remembered why I was in
        Leipzig with my sister in the first place - for an exam of hers. So, I thought, I may as well just buy her some
        sweets she fancies and for my mother simultaneously to delight them. I wanted to share my bliss. A bit later, I
        entered the city center again and encountered a Ferris wheel. I considered going there until I remembered what
        being young is about and what regret feels like - this removed doubt and I just went for a ride and took some
        photos there. After having bought some chocolates for my mother and sister and driven this giant wheel, I had
        two hours left. So I went to a park, sat down, and sensed fulfillment. In this moment of happiness, I worked on
        the text about depression, as I thought that this text must go above and beyond and my texts need to stand out.
        It slowly started to rain. Romantic light warm rain. I went to the train station to meet my sister at four in
        the afternoon. It turned out that we couldn't take the train earlier, my sister complained and I did not worry.
        We had to take the one three and a half hours later, and hence, we drove through Leipzig in twilight via the
        tram in the meanwhile and strolled through the center in beautiful lights until seven in the evening. Having
        walked for eleven hours without eating and only drinking once I felt for the lack of a better word amazing. I
        enjoyed the trip, every stroke of the paintbrush was horror, yet in the end, it painted a beautiful picture,
        since I reached the sublime.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Flow and the rare sublime.</strong></em> Every person knows magical moments, just like the trip. You
        seem to not care about anything and are in a permanent flow. Every problem fades into insignificance and gets
        replaced by fulfillment. This sensation has lasting effects for the next few days or even weeks, sometimes
        forever. However, this feeling is rare for most, because it arrives when you enter a flow of discomfort. If you
        normally run for two kilometers a day and run twenty out of nothing, just because the flow gave you the power to
        do so, that's when this feeling will come naturally and be so strong that it outshines every other, every worry
        or fear. It's the feeling you can get if you were to wake up in the middle of the night to write such a text
        (which I definitely didn't do) and it's the feeling you get when you drive at night through an empty and quiet
        rural area, knowing that you are alone in your warm and lit spaceship. You are just outside of what is usual and
        start to enter that which is strange. In those moments you don't even desire music. You ride your car and your
        mind is absolutely clear, you are free of worries and earthly problems that seem irrelevant, and now you've
        entered the spiritual realm. Some people feel very motivated in the deep night, because they reach a form of the
        sublime, and it energizes. </p>

    <p><em><strong>This is the only true emotion.</strong></em> Everything else is just a lie. Anger, fear, worries, …
        you let go of them all and come to peace with yourself and the world. Happiness seems to be a lie in the
        presence of depression, yet the sublime's opposite is death herself personally, yet death is impossible in the
        mind of someone living. There is no opposite that can undermine the meaning of the peaceful sublime. Peace does
        not mean passivity - peace means that you establish the certainty of success, you are at one with the goal you
        are hunting. Now you are invincible and fully awake. Slowly nothing makes sense anymore - you don't understand
        how you were able to be undisciplined, because now every desire is gone. The thinking mind goes to sleep and the
        true, infinite mind takes its place. There is just unity between you and the world. Ever desireless one sees the
        truth, ever desiring one sees the manifestations. It's the intersection of the material and the spiritual world.
        That is precisely the highest form of human experience. You feel greatness beyond comprehension - that is the
        sublime.</p>

    <p><em><strong>The final lesson?</strong></em> If one were to live every human life that ever existed, exists, or
        will exist, what would the final cognition be? What would this being, per definition the most mature to possibly
        exist, feel? Perhaps a feeling beyond all comprehension - the sublime. It's amusing to speculate what the final
        cognition of this being will be, what is the greatest wisdom? No, it's not dying your hair and neither is
        philosophizing about it. Is the lesson to love unconditionally or is to find peace from within and is there even
        a distinction? The teachings of Daoism capture this perfectly, one must be free of concepts to see the world as
        it is. Not formulas, no chemicals, …, the world is more complex than that. Doubtlessly, that's how this being
        will experience the world, as the sublime is beyond comprehension. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Putting the universe together.</strong></em> The sublime establishes a strong sense of connectedness.
        Something in the universe strives to be connected. Humans want to be together, even in the absence of benefits
        and social hierarchies, power. Animals want to be close to each other as well, some single cellular organisms
        that divide to multiply are found regularly to come together. There were life prospers other does as well.
        Plants only prosper with other plants; a plant will grow higher when not left alone. Sand stays together despite
        it being loose. On a more fundamental level, matter attracts matter, a fundamental force of the universe is
        gravity. Atoms exist because the universe is designed to establish the existence of connective forces. Why do
        particles desire closeness, despite being objects without any reason or soul? Why do planets stay together? The
        strive for connectedness in the universe can't be explained from a scientific point of view. Surely things want
        to be together because of together because of gravity, and atoms want to stay together because of the strong and
        weak nuclear forces. Those forces dictate charges, both positive and negative. Yet, why isn't the universe made
        of loose particles everywhere, why do they seemingly strive for connection? The sublime makes you realize how
        loving the universe is, and how everything is connected. You see, love is central to the sublime experience, as
        it establishes a transcendental connection. Romantic love can feel especially can feel very sublime.</p>

    <p><em><strong>People center their lives around the sublime,</strong></em> as everyone is familiar with this emotion
        - if you want to call it as such. I prefer not to, since you are in a state of peace, meaning you are not
        limited by emotions anymore. Its essence is hardwired into the psyche. The sublime is central to art,
        philosophy, aesthetics, ethics, and religion, it's not a component, but the core. They try to capture the human
        experience and extend it. How do you feel after watching a great movie, or a movie from your final class trip
        thirty years after it passed? Religion is one of the most important sources of the sublime, as you can feel
        invincible and at peace also when God blesses you and you feel his presence in the church. If you aren't
        Christian, the sublime can also be reached in a beautiful temple. The reason for the decline in Christianity in
        the western hemisphere can also be partially explained by too much institutionalization, as it makes people
        forget the sublime, some people perceive going to the church as a chore because of it. People center their lives
        around the sublime and there is the fake sublime and an authentic one.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Fake and real sublime.</strong></em> Guess which sublime feels better and whether it coincides with
        the sublime preferred by most. Most people chase the fake sublime, one achieved through parties, shopping, and
        addiction. The superior person chases the authentic sublime, one reached by getting in a flow, the person beyond
        superior, the indescribably superior person chases the sublime reached by getting in a flow of intense
        discomfort. The flow is a magical experience… At the center of every person's life, there is the fear of death.
        One can't cope with this fear. Hence, most people live their lives as if consciousness is their biggest curse.
        Accepting death is helpful, except that it doesn't work! So, one must forget it, by numbing oneself or by
        embracing full consciousness and living the spiritual way of life. The perception of time is central to the
        human experience and time is utterly subjective, to the point where it seems as if nothing is objective. The
        sublime makes it fly by, you will get so immersed in your task that the flow makes you forget about time... One of
        the central aspects that explains people is how well they handle the fear of death, they either give up by
        thinking that it's irrelevant and instead indulge in cheap pleasures. Those of the body, meat, and
        entertainment. Addictions are there to overwhelm one so that one forgets death and one's consciousness. Other
        forms of refusing to accept death include toxic friends, they create useless tension to create 'meaning.' If
        there is a lack of meaning, one will create it: won't people ruin paradise just to prove their point? The real
        sublime comes from within, and not from external pleasures. The sublime reached by alcohol is short-lasting and
        not particularly effective, because you aren't even conscious in that time! It's easy to forget that one must
        categorically refuse various fake sublimes, such as drugs. The fake sublime worsens your life, it drains you of
        energy and of the zest for life and you secretly hope for things to end or for something interesting to happen
        to overwhelm you, so that you forget that every moment matters and sooner than later you will die and there is
        nothing you can do about it. One can also view the fake sublime as inherent sin and the sublime feeling as a
        reward for 'living right', i.e. the inauthentic sublime found at a party at midnight constitutes sin while
        reaching the sublime through hard expresses God's will. Hence, one can identify the utility of what is good and
        evil carried through religion and scripture and also find a common element of evolution thereof. That which is
        decadent is a sin, that which is not is excepted. Thus, do not pursue the fake sublime. The real sublime can be
        reached with enough consciousness, when one does not try to hide that one will die. It's by embracing life and
        rejecting earthly pleasures. It's by giving the mind the presence it desires, not by suppressing it. How to
        establish presence? - With the edge and the flow, short, the sublime. The genuine sublime is strong and
        permanent enough to make discipline come at ease, consciousness, presence, and discipline are the same thing.
        Thus, rejecting earthly pleasures brings consciousness and presence, which the mind craves, unless numbed. Once
        you get a taste of the real sublime, especially by doing work that brings you in the flow, you will not want to
        do anything different, everything else will seem to you impossible to bear because of its banality. Chocolate? -
        No, I'm rather writing on my novel. Believe it or not, working on something that brings you in the flow gives
        you energy, it does not drain it. Let me repeat; meaningful work gives energy. I wish everyone a life where they
        are in utter lust to do the things they excel at, one with infinite energy unleashed.</p>


    <p><em><strong>The last unanswered question</strong></em> is whether materialism or idealism is superior. I would
        say, it's ideal, the spiritual. The sublime makes you touch the infinite spiritual, and the material dominates
        when you aren't in a flow. Yet, because the sublime is the highest human experience, it's plausible to deduct
        that the spiritual is above the material, just as the heaven is above the earth. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Permanent sublime.</strong></em> You may think that you can't touch the sublime perpetually because
        it's unrealistic. False, that's too pragmatic. I touch the sublime every day, every day I don't I'm depressed.
        Every day away from the sublime is wasted. The sublime unleashes energy in sheer abundance. I've been writing
        for a while now, making me reach the sublime. After I'm done with writing, why not reach the sublime with sports
        and walking, all while being fasted? There is something for every human that brings him in the flow, most people
        just haven't discovered it yet. If you discover it, you will understand that no pleasure is higher and more
        permanent than the sublime. If you discover it, I must caution you, because an irresistible trap will start to
        lure you! There is no way to go back, as you will realize that life with the sublime is infinitely more
        desirable than one without. Don't think that you'll get used to the sublime if you experience it every day,
        there is no baseline to it, as there is always a horizon, no matter how far you look. There will be things that
        always bring in the flow, especially if you master your craft. </p>

    <p><em><strong> Spiritual awakening.</strong></em> There is a way to reach the sublime once and for all, for it to
        never fade, for you to always be in a flow. That's what happens when you open your eyes in the walled garden and
        realize that you are naked. Through enough daily meditation and deep breaths, one can achieve peace of mind.
        Unexpectedly one is going to wake up; you will realize that everything is an illusion, and these three seconds
        are going to break your past self and create a new one, a self that controls its mind to an extent where most
        people have doubt. That's when every worry is going to disappear almost permanently and almost every problem
        will cease to be one and things will become effortless. There is no better life than one where discipline comes
        at ease, as this makes one invincible. The material world opens when you reach the spiritual.</p>
