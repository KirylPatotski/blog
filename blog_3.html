  <h2><strong>What a jouney taught me</strong></h2>

  <p>In the middle of May of 2023, I went on a little trip to Austria. Even though it was May, the weather was not clear
    and warm. Well, now you may be asking, what
    everything has to do with mental math and distractions.</p>

  <p><strong>Well, I intended to write about a new mental math app and ended up talking about the weather in Austria.
      What a journey!</strong></p>

  <p>In Vienna, we arrived at our hotel and started to go sightseeing the next day. While in the hotel I worked, on
    YouTube and on my app. The work there has not been very productive because there was no desk in the hotel, instead I
    laid in bed and my productivity was 30% reduced, even if considering my work ethic. The trip to Austria, living
    where Germany, Poland, and Czechia meet, started on Wednesday after school (actually I cut out school on that day
    partially) and lasted till Saturday noon. On Wednesday we arrived late, so we did not do anything there. On the next
    day, I went, together with my family sightseeing to a palace and drove across Vienna with a sightseeing bus. The sky
    was grey and dull on that day. Friday was different, weather-wise and I walked through the center of Vienna. Vienna
    is a very old city, with a lot of architecture over from 150 years ago, matching this style there were a bunch of
    horses with carriages. While looking at the horses, I noticed something. The horses had black eyelashes, to limit
    their distraction and make them focus better. Like this, the horses are only able to go forward and cut themselves
    from any other option. They show absolute focus without any distractions, they only see the target in front of them!
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><u><strong>Remove distractions for a higher speed and limit perspective to focus with full force, just like the
          horses do it.</strong></u></li>
    <li><u>Look forward in order to accelerate, don't look at the side because you will end up going where you look.</u>
    </li>
    <li><u>Cut out any alternatives</u></li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>How did that lead to the creation of a new app?</strong></p>

  <p>I saw the horses and it made one thing clear. Let's get back to the beginning of this essay. Originally this essay
    talked about a new mental math app, but I ended up talking about horses! That's how much distraction you experience
    every day!</p>

  <p>Let me give you another example: you want to watch a new video on YouTube. Instead of seeing just the video, which
    is desirable, you end up looking at other videos, at the comments, and the views, instead of looking forward you
    will be looking to the side and distracting yourself.</p>

  <p>The same thing can be said about my main mental app <em>Helimath</em>. Its code contains over 300 Files, and as
    many 70 000 words, so this essay is 100 times over in complexity and length. Guess how much code is used to generate
    mental math tasks? Only 5000 words, so 7%, and the other 93% are simply there to make the app fun, useable, and
    display everything. (Well 5000 words is still a lot, but that's because you need to consider a lot of different
    scenarios, exceptions, and customization) Some features take up a lot of code and have a small impact on the actual
    experience. I don't want to complain here, but I also think that 75% of all features of all apps are completely
    useless and just a distraction to make the boss feel like something changes while no real, meaningful, influential
    work is being done, these are all just fillers.</p>

  <p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
  <p>The core message of this text is to reflect, that most things are simply distractions and distractions slow down.
    Another interesting message is hidden between the lines. Find opportunities everywhere, in every thing you learn and
    experience, and act fast.</p>

  <p>I took action on the same day, because I focused on what's improtant.</p>
