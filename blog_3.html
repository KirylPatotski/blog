  <h1><strong>What a journey taught me</strong></h1>

  <p>Even though it was May, Austria's capital, Vienna, was not clear and warm. We arrived at our hotel on Wednesday
    evening, May 17th, 2023. I live where Germany, Poland, and Czechia meet, so the drive took a bit.</p>

  <p>The next day, my family and I started sightseeing. We drove across Vienna on a sightseeing bus. The sky was grey
    and dull that Thursday. While in the hotel, I worked on my YouTube and mental math app; I love my work. Despite my
    work ethic, the work wasn’t remarkably productive; a desk was lacking in the hotel. </p>
  <p>
    Friday was sunny and clear. I walked through downtown Vienna. Austria’s historic capital is abundant in
    architectural variety. Accordingly, to match the city’s aesthetics and to lure tourists, there were horses with
    horsecars. </p>

  <p>While looking at the horses, I noticed something. </p>

  <p>The horses had black eyelashes. Why? To focus. They aren’t allowed to look to the side, only forward. Otherwise,
    they would end up distracted and irritated. Their focus calms them while speeding them up.</p>

  <p>That also applies to you. Remove distractions to speed up. Limit perspective to focus with full force. You will go
    where you look; hence, look at your goal. Cut out any alternatives. — Focus</p>
