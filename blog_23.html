    <h1>Best 57 minutes and 2 seconds of my life</h1>

    <p>I have been stuttering and speaking unclearly for a long time now. I did go to therapy for it since 2022 and it
        did help a lot. But my speech is still far away from perfection. My first YouTube video, where I spoke was
        released in March 2023. I was constantly stuttering and had to cut it out, that's why the video sounded wrong at
        many points. Also, I had to give everything multiple tries, I tried to record one video 6 times (I didn't want
        to quit). That's because it's a lot harder to talk in front of the camera than it is to a speech therapist. When
        the camera is turned on, everything is recorded for eternity. I would sit down and speak through the script 3
        times, with perfection, but as soon as turned on the camera, my stutters returned.</p>

    <p>As I recorded my first video, I was too incompetent to memorize a 300-word script and had to look at my laptop.
        The next few were better and I looked at my notebook instead. Now, I reached a point where I don't need
        anything, not even a script. Practice makes perfect. Here is how:</p>

    <p>My summer holidays began on the 3rd July week of 2023. I considered my <a href="blog_19.html">burnout</a> to be over at that point in time,
        so I took my camera and recorded 2 videos. (By the way: at that point, my last uploaded video was at the
        beginning of my burnout, where I tried to stop it with momentary success, and documented it. This was the first
        unscripted video and also the first one, where I would break free from my desk. Prior to this, I was unable to,
        my skills were not enough. This burnout video was the 15th, so I already had a little bit of experience.) The
        first one was about priorities and how to plan and prioritize and the second one explained why you should stop
        listening to music for 30 days. As I'm writing this, I have published neither, even though I have edited both. I
        edited both videos and as I edited the second one, I have reached a tipping point. I have had enough of my
        stutters and wrong speech; I have had enough of editing them out! </p>

    <p>That was on Wednesday, 12th 2023. I was going for 2 weeks to Spain, Catalonia, from 13.7.2023 - 27.7.2023 and I
        identified an opportunity. Every day, I would be making diary entries in the form of a video, unscripted and
        always first-try. I set my aim for 5 minutes a day - for 14 days, that's 70 minutes.</p>

    <p>That's exactly what I did. I took my camera almost every day (if I didn't, I would record it the next day) and
        spoke in front of the camera out of the blue, with no preparation. I talked about every day I was in Spain, even
        when nothing happened. </p>

    <p>Things take as long as you want them to take. Why the hell didn't I invest these 70 minutes before I recorded my
        first video? I would have saved so much time. If you speak in front of the camera 14 times in a row, there is no
        doubt that your results are going to be phenomenal! If you write a blog for 14 days in a row, the quality of
        your texts will increase much faster than you expect. If you give a compliment per day, your social skills will
        skyrocket! If there is something that needs repetition to be perfected, do it, now. </p>
