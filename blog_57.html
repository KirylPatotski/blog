    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400">Thoughts on a failed app</span></h1>

    <h1>It's my fault</h1>

    <p>The text “You deserve it” explains that people don't want help until it's too late most of the time and they
        often never take preventive measures, that means, people don't want the solution to a problem “they don't have”.
        I have brought phone usage as an example. But there is nothing remotely special about phone usage and rather, it
        applies to any concept. You need to think long-term, I did and wrote the text “You deserve it” on Monday and
        already conceptualized this continuation because I almost expected things to happen this way. </p>

    <p>I have had apps for a really long time now, at least from my perspective. I published my first app on 23.8.2022 -
        just 367 days ago. I knew that an app itself wasn't enough, because otherwise, it would be like all the other
        99.5% of apps - just being little side projects, never designed to become successful. I needed to launch an
        attack on all fronts and build a system around it, a brand, a business, and a platform. So, from day 1 on I
        started to think constantly about how to build said business.</p>

    <p>My first attempts all failed in Winter 2023 and I had to try something new, I hesitated for a very long time,
        (read the text <a href="blog_50.html">"Failures kill"</a> for more information about it) and in February 2023 I
        took the courage to start advertising and it failed.</p>

    <p>I built up even more fear and in August, I solved it by advertising multiple times and I failed again.
        Specifically, I failed with multiple video ads. I could comment on why I failed. That would be irrelevant to you
        because I didn't succeed and saw both sides of the medal. </p>

    <p>But I think the main reason was a wrong strategy. My apps are better than the competition, but this doesn't mean
        that people will want to use them, because they still need to see the problems themselves. Another reason is
        that great things take time and everything comes at the right time - there are no shortcuts. </p>

    <p>There is a reason this text looks different from all the others, this one is not a motivational song but rather a
        <em>bittersweet</em> piano one, because I have this week of failed ad campaigns made me immune to <em>fear of
            failure</em>, while the summer holidays made me able to attempt any challenge. That means now my mind is
        complete.
    </p>

    <p>My strategy was the wrong one and I feel no regret, I almost feel bliss. I tried my best and still failed. But it
        doesn't matter. I will not stop until I win. There are hardly any 16-year-olds with this amount of life lessons.
        However, I have to acknowledge that I'm not at that level. Regardless, I'm grateful.</p>
