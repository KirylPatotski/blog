    <h1>Looking back on getting rejected<br> by my dream girl</h1>

    <p>It's tempting to look at the mistakes I made. Firstly, I made the mistake of being unsure, while knowing that I
        wanted her. Secondly, my personality was very stable prior, but massive character shifts made me hesitant, i.e.
        I underestimated my development. Thirdly, I spoke too much on my blog, especially much in my weaker times.
        Fourthly, I focused too much on her. Yet, were those genuine mistakes? </p>

    <p><em><strong>Before March 2023.</strong></em> My life was very straightforward. Work. In December '20, at 13 years
        of age, I started to grip my life by learning how to program. And since February '23 one hour of gym per day. I
        grinded all day long, and 14-hour days were frequent. Since December '22 I started to break free from every bad
        habit and in March it was pretty much complete. I freed my mind. In December '22 I started to become social,
        prior only work existed. Everything in my life was very linear and was going uphill pretty fast in every area.
        My personality didn't change in two years, it remained more or less the same. </p>

    <p><em><strong>March 2023.</strong></em> In March, I started to <em>make my hair</em>, as I started my current
        YouTube channel. I waited until March since I used to stutter and I also waited until I got done with my 3rd
        app, a simpler version of my main mental math app, which I had to abandon six months later since they failed. In
        late March I had pretty much eliminated every bad habit I had, mainly social media consumption. I stopped eating
        sugar four years ago at that time, so that wasn't a problem. So, I had pretty much gained control over my life.
        On a random day, my sister told me, that there was a girl in our grade who matched fairly precisely with what I
        imagined to be perfect. Naturally, I got a crush on her. </p>

    <p><em><strong>April and May 2023.</strong></em> I knew, however, that my social skills were almost nonexistent
        since my life consisted of work and traumas prior. I wasn't pretty either and going to the gym for two months
        wasn't sufficient. So, I continued to push hard on these areas. The motivation boost was enormous. In the middle
        of April, my traumas evaporated because of the crush. In May, I set myself the deadline to ask her out on June
        1st. Out of nothing, post-May 22nd I started to feel dim sadness, despite living perfectly, I was outside for 3
        hours a day and had productivity I never had before. Turns out, I pushed too hard and now I know that this dim
        sadness is a personal sign of burnout. </p>

    <p><em><strong>June 2023.</strong></em> I had no idea I was burning out and needed a break, and life continued. On
        June 1st, the day I wanted to ask her out, I sat next to her and one random guy I didn't like, and I concluded
        that she had zero interest in me because I asked her questions and she didn't ask a single question back. It
        hurt. So, I failed on my deadline, which hurt even more. Looking back, this time was sweet, I had no clue of
        anything and the sky is starry when you are young. Then, on the night of June 7th, I got the idea for a blog and
        by June 8th, noon I had published 3 texts and set up the website, which looks exactly like it does today. No one
        would believe me that the channel March and the blog in June have nothing to do with her, it was perhaps
        natural. Despite this girl not seeming to be interested, my grandmother recommended I ask her out anyway, and on
        Friday, June 9th I did. My five in the morning walk felt intense, I was decently nervous. I got back home, ate,
        and went to school. For the last few months, I always saw her where I entered the school, but today
        coincidentally not. So, I asked her out via phone - and got rejected. Initially, it wasn't too bad as
        simultaneously my stepfather returned from America and told me that I could start at a company there as a
        programmer. Also, it wasn't too bad as I had still things to do. Due to a lack of experience, I dismissed this
        dim sadness from May and continued to do things. Things started to go downhill a few days later when my burnout
        started to unleash to its fullest extent and I was effectively knocked out for ten days. After getting rejected
        and letting a few more days pass, I felt no less pain than before and I didn't fade, <em>failures kill</em>.
        Some people say nonsense like “If you get rejected, the interest is just going to fade.” - yet that never
        happened, even as 12 months passed. I simply couldn't find a better girl than her, despite her flaws revealed in
        the following months. Another flaw that hurt a lot is seeing her in a party photo in the school's yearbook. But
        at least I knew that my sadness from May was caused by fifty failures that I encountered in the past months by
        living extremely and a fifty-first failure wouldn't be too bad. I practically didn't see her since then, she
        always hid. </p>

    <p><em><strong>July and August 2023.</strong></em> The summer holidays started and I struggled to move on. I knew
        what kind of person I was, I knew that I got asked out by three girls, so I couldn't understand how I could have
        gotten rejected. I knew how hard I could commit to things and I knew who I was as a person, it deeply baffled
        me. She wrote back in June that she was taken; so, there were 4 possible scenarios. </p>

    <p>(1) I thought she was lying and simply didn't like me.<br>
        (2) She lied and regretted doing so.<br>
        (3) She was indeed taken and had a loser friend whom things would end badly with rather soon.<br>
        (4) There was also the option that she was taken and the guy was even more attractive than me.<br>
    </p>

    <p>I could not comprehend her having a man more attractive than me, looking at how I lived the past months and
        years. Neither could I comprehend that she gets turned on by a random characterless beta. Consequently, I
        assumed that she was interested in me secretly and lived by that or that she didn't like me because she
        misjudged me, after all, I changed faster than anyone could notice. So, I didn't move on in the slightest. </p>

    <p><em><strong>September 2023.</strong></em> The school year started and I encountered her rarely, she still always
        hid, which wasn't the case before I asked her out. To test my 4 hypotheses empirically, one should perhaps been
        less hesitant and asked her out again. I didn't, because she pretended that I didn't exist, so there was no
        point in doing so. Wondering what could have been if I acted differently is not something I have ever done in my
        250.000 written words, and so neither am I going to do it here. My life was pretty great by September. I lived a
        lot less extreme than in the spring, and since my burnout, I stopped working stupidly as I did in the spring.
        September however had a hit. Firstly, I had to abandon all of my apps, as I had to painfully admit that they
        failed after multiple ad campaigns. I lost what I worked on for years and it made me weak. Then, I got weaker
        again when I heard her brag about a random loser, how great he is, and how they will spend the autumn holidays
        together. To top it all, the final class trip made me even weaker, as I got surrounded by weakness; 'You need to
        eat sugar otherwise you will have a massive burnout'. If one of the key takeaways from this text is to be less
        hesitant, I don't think that asking her out again would be a great idea, as I declined hard. I started to eat
        sugar, despite stopping it four years ago, as an example of my low discipline. </p>

    <p><em><strong>October 2023.</strong></em> I changed a lot due to the failure of my app, I had to let go of what
        dominated my life. I my purpose of programming as a whole. It did have entrepreneurship at its deeper core, but
        I struggled to use my time effectively, I was weakened too much. The period from September to October,
        therefore, would have been pointless to spend together, I'm not sure a depressed partner is desirable. During
        the autumn holidays, I saw her almost every day on my walks - maybe she read my blog? Then, on October 22nd, I
        decided to go on a walk and simply move on. I thought I would think everything through and then make a decision.
        The walk was emotionally painful and twenty kilometers long. Especially on the way back, when it was already
        getting dark, I started to get haunted by seeing pairs of motorbikes speeding by and I found the imagination
        horrible that one of them could be her. That's still something that haunts me, seeing her with another man and I
        no longer want to be afflicted by this nonsense. I'm a very fast person when it comes to <em>everything</em>
        outside of love, after returning, I had published a 4000-word text by the next morning. This walk had a twist,
        it's the reason I'm still wearing a scarf, the other twist was that I wrote in this text, #87, for the first
        time about this girl, where I described that I'm going to move on. I don't know how I wrote the first 86 texts
        without mentioning her, not even implicitly. I completely swept it under the carpet. I don't know, maybe that's
        why she thought I lost interest? Doesn't quite matter, the next time I saw her, two days after text #87 had been
        online, she stopped pretending as if I didn't exist. This caused a real mental battle inside of me because since
        then, she didn't hide her friendship with that loser she bragged about to her friends in September either. I
        gained pretty solid evidence she was reading my blog and couldn't understand why she was pretending I didn't
        exist prior. Moving on was now harder than ever, despite me training myself not to think about her anymore, #88.
    </p>

    <p>So instead of moving on, I wrestled with myself whether I wanted her. I started to think, 'I'm not perfect
        either, nobody is and certainly flaws appear' or other things like 'I'm thinking too much'. I was asking myself
        whether our lives were diverging; I ascended, and she descended. She was a bit ordinary, addicted to the
        dopamine of social media, the serotonin of male loser validation, the delusion of atheism, the hedonism of
        parties, and the unspiritual pleasure of dyeing one's hair. I battled in my mind, how come she's attractive and
        her lifestyle contradicts my values? I started to fight in my mind if it should not be permitted for her to
        upload an unprovoking picture of herself to the internet while knowing what it does to one. I wrestled with
        whether it was okay to dye one's hair from brown to blonde. I fought with myself about whether I wanted to
        accept her male friends who all would use her in the erotic sense if given the chance. This conflict between
        reality and my concepts made me sick, but resulted in many of the most brilliant texts I produced so far. On
        text, it may be clear, but that's only one side I'm portraying here, she was the most attractive girl I
        encountered so far regardless. She wouldn't need to fundamentally change, at least from what I knew minor
        adjustments would have been enough. Nonetheless, I can be proud of myself, even in my weakest days, I refused to
        bury my values. </p>

    <p><em><strong>November and December 2023.</strong></em> If I had asked her out right after #87, it would not help
        either, I continued to decline until Christmas and even became depressed. You must imagine, after three years of
        self-improvement, and never having been depressed prior! Partially so, because I wanted to ask out her again and
        saw her with that loser instead. Other reasons played a role as well, for example, the driving school question
        or the fact that I still couldn't restore my discipline. The battle between concepts and reality continued. What
        made my emotional state arguably a lot worse was opening up. I learned the hard way that I'm not a girl and that
        if I open up about my 'problems' they become a lot worse. I talked about her with another girl and it made me
        even more sick. I didn't know prior that opening up makes me depressed. 'That stupid bitch rejected you, but
        it's ok, who cares?' is much better for my emotional well-being than 'Why did you love her'. I simply had to
        accept that I'm not feminine in the slightest and every man who thinks that opening up is a good idea is
        excessively feminine. Don't open up as a man, chewing on pain doesn't make it go away. Also, in my winter
        sickness, I started to develop to be overly philosophical, which is not sexy. Generally, my personality became
        fragile post-September. Since that walk in late October, I had been wearing a scarf and was too weak to do
        sports, so I lay in bed pretty much all day long and had nothing to do but write. I can just blame the weather.
        I can also blame myself for pushing hard for 31 months straight and then wondering why I need a few months of
        lower productivity. </p>

    <p><em><strong>January and February 2024.</strong></em> Things then took a turn… Since I was in 12th grade, we got
        to make a yearbook and there was a vote, on which girl was the prettiest in the grade. On January 12th, I sat
        with two classmates on a train to the opera in Dresden and I asked a classmate who she voted to be the
        prettiest, (don't remember her answer) and I let her guess who I voted for, she guessed correctly on the first
        try. We talked about her and I learned a lot. For one, she was indeed taken in the summer and as I predicted
        correctly, their relationship did not end well, I got confirmed in thinking that her boyfriend was a complete
        loser, though I have never met or seen him. That means, if I didn't hesitate, it would have been for nothing
        anyway. Then, I also learned that this loser she bragged about in September helped her to get over the breakup.
        I don't know if I should put 'help to get over a breakup' in quotation marks. However, from the perspective of
        moving on, this was horrible, I didn't need to hear how great she was. I didn't learn my lesson that I should
        never open up. I didn't need to hear that she is one of the brightest girls and neither did I need to find out
        that she never drank at parties. I also discussed with that classmate why I deeply disliked that loser, and she
        almost convinced me that I was not thinking straight. Ironically, this was one of the slow turning points and I
        started to be a lot less depressed. I started to regain some strength. </p>

    <p>Suddenly, I started to think that I should ask her out then, regardless of every circumstance. I decided, that I
        love her strongly enough. I decided that time was not in anyone's favor. Enough of thinking in concepts. - Or
        rather, if I wanted her to quit social media, better now than in 3 months. I asked her out on Friday the 26th of
        January for the second time and she gave an answer that implied rejection. On Monday the 29th I gave her a
        3600-word love letter I wrote. Then, she responded that she definitely wanted nothing to have to do with me. My
        character became fragile for a few days and later weeks to come. But then, I thought, I must stop pretending
        that I'm weak and I thought to myself that I must try to fight for her heart. So, a few days later I invited her
        to my party and she wasn't interested.</p>

    <p>This surprisingly freed me of regret, I did what I could. My friends came to that party and they instead helped
        me to come to peace, which retrospectively wasn't a good idea, talking about it made things worse. Again, I
        didn't need to hear that she would be a great mother and housewife. Opening up isn't real as a man. The entire
        month of February was shaped by my even more fragile character, I knew quite well where my flaws lay and tried
        to poke them. I also lied a lot in bed, I was sick during the February holidays. The battle of concepts and
        reality became much more relevant, I started to think, maybe, if given the chance, I should take her with every
        flaw.</p>

    <p><em><strong>March 2024.</strong></em> No. In March, I decided I must not betray myself. I must not be desperate
        and stop deluding myself into thinking that her red flags are indifferent. One year passed since I fell in love
        with her, and it shaped me a lot, I changed a lot as a person for the better. I have become a lot more humble,
        loving, and compassionate, especially since October. While you may think that this made me too feminine, trust
        me, this was necessary, my attitude was awful prior. From December 1st to February 29th, I decided to create 50
        videos in 90 days and I completed this goal. On March 1st, I was full of inspiration and started to write a
        text, 'How to be a good girl and why'. This text gave me peace but changed something inside of me, I started to
        deconstruct my weakness that collected itself since September. I started to deconstruct my philosophical period
        that dominated the winter. Philosophy is not sexy and neither is writing about your flaws. I started to
        deconstruct my attitude of humility and I deconstructed the attitude that said I should not hate losers. I ended
        the battle between concepts and reality, looks like the concepts that served me well took over. The text that
        followed, 'Complacency', deconstructed my wrong development and weakness even further. She has loser male
        friends and that makes me depressed is a concept. Accepting that I must not tolerate such nonsense is much
        healthier than 'accepting that reality is more complicated and things aren't always clear, she may be a great
        girl regardless of that flaw'. Retrospectively, I would not have taken myself in my weaker versions from
        September to late February. Slowly I'm returning to strength and peace - and strong boundaries. </p>

    <p>Hence, the best time would be now, not four months ago. Now I'm strong again. But now I'm never seeing her again.
        I doubt I want her
        unless she matures and realizes her wrong and fights for my heart. I doubt she will change her mind and I doubt
        whether that would be a good thing to be with. I doubt now she will try to find me on my walks and try to win
        me. I doubt she learned anything. If I'm wrong in my doubt, she shall fight for me. - I can be almost certain,
        none of these will happen in this universe and that my doubts will turn out to be correct.</p>

    <p><em><strong>The lessons I proposed.</strong></em> Was I unsure, unstable in my personality, speaking too much, or
        didn't look enough at other options? - No. Sure, to some extent these lessons are correct. Sure, being fast does
        matter if you see a girl once and then potentially never again, but not so in this case which only caused
        useless suffering. The issue is, that she never loved me and didn't have enough insight to even give me a try.
        It's tempting to think that changing a few words in the love letter would have changed her mind, but that's not
        right to think so; if she loved me, I could have written a subtle insult in every sentence and she would have
        still be moved to tears and love me, that's how women simply are. Maybe she did love me but knew that we weren't
        meant for each other or perhaps she knew she didn't meet my criteria or I didn't meet her expectations. So, the
        lessons I proposed weren't entirely correct. The real lessons are; if she doesn't love you, stop hoping. Don't
        talk about your girl with others if you are trying to move on. Don't assume women are intelligent. Don't even
        consider changing your mind, life or personality to please her. Choose a woman who chooses you. If you get
        rejected, at least do so with dignity. Have high standards, i.e. let concepts and boundaries take over. Do not
        think that life is not a text, otherwise, you are going to live in useless self-inflicted trouble. If there is
        something you dislike and you try to accept it, you will grow resentful; don't try to justify her actions.
        Simply: have higher standards. </p>

    <p>To phrase it more clearly, some idiot may say that some points in my blog are pretty sexist and that's the reason
        why she turned away from me. No, the reason she turned away from me was because she didn't love me. If she loved
        me, it wouldn't occur to her as sexist if I said that women aren't allowed to party. It's very dangerous to
        delude yourself into thinking that switching a single word can make a difference. We might also be incompatible
        in every area and my texts made it clear that had to go above the love that may have existed on her side. One
        could even contradict this point, if I lied, I would have let everyone down and gotten into the wrong
        relationship. You can't pretend to be anyone else, hence, the best lesson in dating is: be yourself but don't be
        a loser. </p>

    <p>More lessons will only crystalize long after. </p>

    <p><em><strong>I'm the alpha and didn't use that.</strong></em> Let me look at another mistake I made, which was
        that I focused too much on this specific girl. I know that everyone in my school of 800 kids knows my name. On
        Thursday, a ~7th grader exclaimed to his classmate; 'This is Kiryl' to which the second one asked me what I
        thought about his wish to become a fat loser. I responded that you gotta do pushups instead, otherwise you won't
        get a hot blonde girl. Everyone else would be too awkward for such a conversation. I brought myself to a point
        where everyone knew who I was and what kind of person I was, and where I was allowed to say any joke and
        propagate any opinion. When a teacher tells me that everyone knows who I am, I can respond with 'Cool, I'm the
        alpha' and everyone would smile, while a year ago I would have been confronted with some feminist garbage and
        'toxic masculinity' instead. People sense whether you are real and genuinely giving your best. I had a bunch of
        status in school and perhaps could have gotten any girl in the grades below. Status starts with sitting upright
        by the way. The problem was that I simply didn't care. It seems as if I like slightly older and bigger girls
        more, despite knowing that this is an issue since kindergarten - at least I can say Napoleon did the same. I
        don't know why, but I can't get myself interested in a 16-year-old girl, they are simply too dumb or have boring
        lives. Generally, I observed that girls (and also boys) below the age of 16 can't talk to me, in the sense that
        I use words but their combinations don't make sense to them, while every adult understands my sense of humor. I
        struggle to find examples here because too many small factors play a role here. There seems to be some
        psychological/neurological barrier ordinary people pass when they are ~16 and I think I skipped it as much as I
        skipped 9th grade. Furthermore, there is no challenge in getting girls who would be easy to get for me. I'm 16
        right now and yesterday was the last day of school, so it's pretty much over anyway. I could try to get one, but
        not with my indifferent attitude from the start. Also, I'm moving away, so what's the point? The only advantage
        of a 16-year-old is that she is almost guaranteed to be a virgin, but there will be enough virgins in university
        as well. The killing argument of all is that I think I will grow complacent if I get a hot blonde 16-year-old
        right now, I'm not in the stage of life where I can afford to go to the cinema or eat ice cream, in the sense
        that ice-cream makes dumb and cinema overstimulates. Furthermore, I know my argumentation is useless if I
        encounter the right one while not even searching.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Revenge?</strong></em> I think the love letter alone was revenge enough. At least, she got one love
        letter in her life and it created a sweet memory. If the love letter isn't revenge enough, my life is a pure
        provocation. If she disagrees and finds my life boring, good for her, she will save herself a lot of regret. I
        didn't develop any resentment towards her, and luckily so, I wish her legitimately the best. (If she is reading;
        don't take the insults personally) She's a great girl. If there is a takeaway for her, my story demonstrates
        that love is real, even when life goes in the way. Whether she wishes herself the best I beg to differ. Most of
        my texts have been written for her, not only for her in mind but directly for her. One such lesson is to stay
        away from losers, especially if those are loser male friends. It seems she didn't learn the hard way after
        having a failed relationship with a loser, and neither did she learn the easy way from countless warnings from
        my texts. Instead, she is just a little hedonist or just plainly ignorant. Now she will learn the easy way and
        turn smart or she will continue until she has to learn in the hardest way possible. If you learn the hardest way
        possible, it may be too late - she will do the revenge part on herself without my effort. The choice is hers.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Why didn't I move on faster?</strong></em> Simple, I loved her and I thought she was the one. I'm
        aware that such a beginning has never a good ending. If you have an ordinary crush, it just goes away on its
        own. If she is ugly and you fall in love, your brain interferes, because you know that you will never pursue an
        ordinary crush. In such a case, you will think to yourself; whatever. Here it was a bit tougher, as I found her
        very attractive. There is also my specific problem with moving on, which is that I can focus until a goal is
        done, which can be seen in many projects, yet here it sort of backfired. Technically, I haven't moved on and
        still think about her once in a while, but without my heart beating fast. I know that I'm able to move on at
        will, at least now, not initially, yet that's boring in my opinion. I kept hoping and had reason to. Since my
        previous purpose evaporated, my apps, and so on, I needed something to obsess over, right? You can move on if
        you want to, you can actively suppress thoughts of hope. You can choose what to think in case you didn't know,
        only losers are at their thought's mercy. Rightly so - if you don't control your thoughts, what do you have
        control over at all? You can move on if you stop thinking about her, that works by you discarding those thoughts
        over and over again. I know many techniques to do so and they work, but I didn't use them, it's fun to have a
        crush. Not moving on made my character development a lot faster, and altogether served me well. If God throws at
        you your dream girl and you can't get her, it's perhaps a sign. - I used it to develop my character. I also have
        to admit, that listening to other people in affairs of love is not so helpful, others saying 'time to move on'
        is not effective, you have to make that decision yourself. You know, there is also some comfort in having a
        crush, that's the true reason I was too weak to move on. The prospect of love is too comforting for one to break
        free from. Sure, it made me develop a lot faster, but the main reason not to move on is that it's comfortable
        and sweet to have that half-certainty, even if it's a delusion. With moving on, there is darkness. This darkness
        is scary. </p>

    <p>The essence of moving on is that it will come automatically, no one can interfere and it's up to your will to
        face the darkness if you want to speed things up.</p>

    <p>Now that I sort of moved on, who do I fantasize about? About the perfect woman. Hopefully, my sister won't tell
        me there is someone directly like <em>her</em>. It's nothing concrete though, just a placeholder. Same benefits,
        none of
        the problems, and a great temporary fix considering that I will need to continue pushing in solitude for a
        while. </p>

    <p>By the way, women never have to face this darkness, they can summon infinite male attention at will, especially
        when they are at their peak attractiveness. </p>

    <p><em><strong>An ego too large.</strong></em> You know, right after the first rejection in June, I simply couldn't
        process it as I thought highly of myself (and also because I never had this experience before). For example, I
        know that there are guys more attractive than me, but I couldn't imagine that she found someone hotter. Later,
        since October, I learned that I needed to reduce my ego and that's what I did. Generally, if your ego is too
        high where it shifts in the direction of arrogance, you will struggle emotionally a lot more when something does
        happen. I want to bring forward another dimension of ego: responsibility. If you take radical responsibility,
        you will progress quickly, however, I recommend for affairs of love and great uncertainty put the responsibility
        to God. That will make you a lot calmer. Let God decide if she will love you or not. When you think about her,
        think of the decision God will make instead. Then, when the mud settles, take radical responsibility, for
        example, do more pushups when she rejects you. If you don't shift responsibility to God, you will crush on her
        for nothing and feel entitled instead of accepting that love is love and not business. Thinking about yourself
        and your feelings and her will make you needy and that is not sexy. Generally, stop thinking about yourself and
        your emotions so much! No wonder you are struggling with discipline if you only think about yourself and not
        your purpose. Moving on will also be a lot easier if you distance yourself from the situation if you don't think
        of yourself all the time. Hence, to face matters of love better, let God decide and distance yourself from the
        situation. Also, think of other people with real struggle.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Who even is she?</strong></em> She does have a few flaws, mainly that she has male friends
        (especially problematic since they're both demons), uses social media, dyes her hair and seems to have an
        assertive-rebellious attitude at times. She also parties. But what I found attractive is that she is feminine,
        does sports, lives a healthy life, has peak health, seems to have a motherly character, conscientious, free of
        traumas, admired by everyone for being warm, trustworthy, and open-minded… She is two years older, a bit taller
        than me, has blue eyes and dyes her brown hair blonde. Her face is beautiful, just like her voice. I could go on
        with describing her, but it's useless. - This story isn't about her, it's about me. She is a girl like every
        other and her life is not going to get better, she has zero intent of improving, at least as of today. I can't
        take her seriously anymore, I deserve better than that. To hell with her! She had the chance to be loyal to me
        and missed it, not only once, but every single second, she refused to make the right choices. Certainly, she
        could learn and try to win my heart, but, dear reader, how likely is that, zero? I've had enough. </p>

    <p><em><strong>In the end, I positioned myself as the winner.</strong></em> I got the lessons and development and
        some more or less inspiring memories, for which I must thank her. Now I'm ready for something new and can let go
        in peace, knowing that I did what I could. Though she mainly brought sadness, that doesn't matter anymore. I
        wanted to have a hard life, I did not want for things to be easy. I'm free of regret, I loved her enough and
        made it clear. I stayed true to myself, and my standards won in the end, not the attitude of accepting things
        and growing resentful in the background. She rejected me? - Cool. Time to be great again. Never did I regret
        letting go. </p>


    <p><em><strong>It was all a test. Did I pass it?</strong></em> </p>

    <p><em>Dear ******,</em></p>
    <p><em>I know you've been indifferent to my struggle, and I doubt I need to give examples. You know
            that you were the only person that could hurt me and you did. But do not worry. I'm fine. Worry about
            yourself, I don't want you to learn the hardest possible way. I want to apologize for every pain I have
            caused and I wish you the best and want to thank you for everything. Who knows, maybe we will cross paths in
            the not-too-distant future and be reminded of the times we were young and naïve. I do not know what the
            future is going to bring. I hope won't tear apart the letter of love I wrote to you and look back on it with
            sweetness.</em> </p>
