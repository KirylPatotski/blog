    <h1>Full creativity guide</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>

    <p>If you read other texts of mine or if you know me in real life, there is a chance you will be too scared to
        implement a guide of mine, because it would force you to restructure your whole life and perfect it with iron
        discipline and determination large enough to move mountains. I know from my own experience, that this isn't
        necessary for creativity since there are artists with no discipline and immense creativity too. Chances are, you
        don't want to have the mental suffering that modern artists grieve from and want something recreateable and
        consistent. However, this will not be an average guide. It's going to get difficult!</p>

    <p><strong><em>Motivation for you</em></strong></p>

    <p>To help you fight through this text, let me remind you of why you are doing it. Being 20% more creative than the
        rest will change the trajectory of your life immeasurably. It will help you to accomplish anything in life you
        desire and will allow for a life of freedom, authenticity, and meaning. Let's say there is a horse race. The
        first horse wins by a nose and the second horse is just a few milliseconds behind, yet the winner gets all. Here
        is another example. Who is the second fastest runner? No one knows. </p>

    <p>20% more creativity compounded over the years will be a massive advantage!</p>

    <h1>How to be more creative</h1>

    <p>The best way to follow this guide is to read it multiple times over to write down those phrases written in
        italics and to repeat them as often as necessary for them to stick. I structured these principles in a way,
        where the radical fundamental things stand in the end, and the things possible to implement right now, are
        closer to the beginning. You don't need to remember 100% of this text, if your creative output increases, you
        will start to do some of these things automatically.</p>

    <h1><strong><u>1. Principles during brainstorming</u></strong></h1>

    <p><strong><em>- Never restrict your thinking</em></strong></p>

    <p>This is the most important principle, hence it's the first one. Whenever you are trying to brainstorm something
        or get a silly idea in general, write it down regardless. If you write it down, it will make space for new
        thoughts or maybe it will get refined and become useful later. Give every idea a try. I didn't want this text to
        turn very sentimental early on, I want you to think about every idea that seemed silly at the beginning and
        could have been discarded right away, but wasn't. How about an idea like <em>“Crypted decentralized internet
        currency to replace the dollar”</em>? Now it's called Bitcoin. Another idea few ideas: <em>“An app which has a photo of
        every place on earth for free, accessible to everyone”</em>, today Google Earth exists with street view. <em>“A device
        able to manufacture every single part component without a cast”</em> materialized as well: a 3D printer. The average
        idea lives only for 5 seconds, why not give it a try, often the crazy ideas are the most creative and inspiring
        ones, and every great innovation sounds silly before it becomes self-evident. Here is another tip, not
        restricting your thoughts starts by not restricting your speech. <em>“The graveyard is the richest country in the
        world, it is full of amazing ideas never tried out because of fear”</em> is one of many sentences that got hardwired
        deep into my psyche and should get hardwired into yours as well. Let your mind go where it needs to or where it
        wants.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Connect and combine</em></strong></p>

    <p>By refining and connecting them, new ideas, maybe useful ones may materialize. As I wrote this text, I
        brainstormed around 25 different principles to incorporate in this text, and many more appeared, because I
        needed to group them, just as now. At the same time, some turned out to be redundant. That means, connecting and
        combining is a simple way to validate and expand your ideas. While connecting them, I wouldn't recommend drawing
        lines, rather, take a new piece of paper and write them down again, a second glance could do wonders.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Rule of 20 ideas</em></strong></p>

    <p>While trying to find new ideas, you must force yourself to write down at least 20 ideas. You don't need to spit
        them out at once, you can take breaks. Writing down 20 ideas allows some obvious, redundant, and useless ideas
        to be eliminated from your mind, and makes place for ideas that are hard to get. After all, never restrict your
        thinking.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Don't be scared of too sudden progress</em></strong></p>

    <p>If you engage in brainstorming sessions, there is a chance you end up writing down 70 ideas. I had that multiple
        times and I started to fear writing down too many ideas at once. Get rid of this self-limiting belief and don't
        be scared of progress. It's a good thing, do what it takes. Stopping a brainstorming session is restricting your
        thinking and is the equivalent of stopping a marathon halfway because it suddenly got easier. It's normal to
        have phases of extreme creativity and phases with none, you will need to learn to handle it. Getting 70 ideas at
        a time has become very rare recently.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Use paper not some tech-nonsense</em></strong></p>

    <p>I don't know whether there was ever an innovation, invention, patent, idea, book, painting or anything else
        requiring huge levels of creativity started on a tablet on some silly note-taking app. Digital mediums lower
        memorization and comprehension, which means, you are less likely to remember your ideas, as a result, you won't
        be able to find follow-up ideas. Now you may argue against yourself by saying: <em>“I have no problems using some
        app”</em>, I would respond: <em>“Remember why you wanted to be creative in the first place. By using this tech stuff, you
        are sacrificing a lot of creativity for nothing.”</em> Digital mediums make stupid, bluntly speaking and you already
        know it. You want to get superior results, so do what it takes and eliminate electronics in the idea-finding
        process. Keep this in mind. I would also recommend you print this guide; I will provide a <a href="pdf/Full Creativity Guide - Kiryl P.pdf" download>PDF</a> variant too, which
        I spent of time on. </p>

    <p>From a spiritual perspective, this digital stuff doesn't allow your thoughts to enter the physical realm. Leaving
        the spiritual realm, the comprehension on a screen is handicapped severely. I'm only able to spot mistakes after
        printing this document on paper. It also feels a lot better, because now I have something physical.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Often it takes just 2 minutes</em></strong></p>

    <p>If you think about your brainstorming session all day long and then start it, it may only 2 minutes after which
        you have written down every idea. Don't fear it and just start.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Be alone to avoid crowd stupidity</em></strong></p>

    <p>Being in groups can cause some unwanted effects, mainly group stupidity. Your brain turns off because you rely on
        others to do the work. Exchange can be valuable, but only after the creative brainstorming phase.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Try to think about everything</em></strong></p>

    <p>Condition yourself to think about everything at all times. Many actions of mine are based on the assumption, that
        I may regret not paving the way for my future self. That's why I have no problem always giving my best. Here is
        an example. In April, I thought of interesting ways to promote my apps. I got 2 ideas and implemented one just a
        few days later and it failed, the second idea was simply solving 10,000 math tasks and making a YouTube video
        out of it. I thought from multiple perspectives simultaneously. How do I demonstrate ruthless commitment and
        confidence in my products, with minimum effort while maximizing memorability? I would also think everything
        through in autistic detail, for example where I would position the cameras. Months passed and I finally executed
        it without any problems. Because I kept in mind my future self.</p>

    <p>Another aspect of thinking about everything can be seen right here, in these blogs. Sometimes crucial elements
        disappear under the carpet since they are sometimes too obvious or too hidden. You need to try to think about
        them too. How that works, is explained later on in <em>“Master universal though”</em> Here is a summary: engage in
        creative output regularly: write or program. Planning is a great way to practice as well. Other forms of output
        such as photography, poetry, or painting aren't well-suited to improve this skill, yet it's essential.</p>

    <h1><strong><u>2. Getting ready for brainstroming</u></strong></h1>

    <p><strong><em>- Boredom, input and exchange</em></strong></p>

    <p>Creativity is knowledge having fun; therefore, knowledge is required to have a foundation. If you know nothing,
        how are you supposed to find ideas, where are they supposed to come from? I would recommend reading, YouTube can
        work too. YouTube works only under one condition: the video must be at least 15 minutes long. A 6-minute video
        will always be too shallow to be of value in comparison to a 1-hour guide. Read as much as possible. Read. Read
        for 2 hours a day, billionaires do it too. The exchange of knowledge is input too: share knowledge with
        abundance, it will make understand it better yourself and find new connections. If you give good advice, they
        may return it too and help you with it. However, before the brainstorming session, deprive yourself of any input
        for at least 15 minutes. Extreme boredom with a longer duration is even better, sometimes weeks or days are
        necessary. It's okay to be bored, it's not okay to try to be entertained 24 hours a day. Boredom is necessary to
        sort things out. </p>

    <p>These 15 minutes can be bridged with meditation. Meditation is very simple. You start to focus on something,
        preferably your breath, and try to think about nothing else. You will notice your mind wandering again
        eventually, and then you simply refocus. Refocusing again is like doing mental pushups, you don't need to be
        angry for losing focus, because that's progress! Do this for 15 minutes every day for the rest of your life and
        your life quality will improve immensely. Remove distractions for a higher speed and limit perspective to focus
        with full force. </p>

    <p>On the 12th of January 2023, my sister and I went to the open-door day of the Technical University Dresden. I
        didn't want to go, because, rightfully, I had better things to do, I would have worked on my app. My sister
        wanted to become a teacher in my perception, and I went to a physics lecture about some quantum stuff. I got
        extremely bored for 90 minutes, during boredom my mind could go wild and I got many inspiring ideas for my apps.
        I still use the ideas from that day until now, 31st October. These 90 minutes of boredom were highly
        influential, my burnout in June 2023 was one logical consequence after I tried many of these ideas, and 95% of
        them failed. I remember waking up on a day in May, full of confidence to try out one idea that I got. I
        downloaded some sample code, opened the coding app, and started. By 6:22 this idea was already dead. Be fast and
        try out your ideas to make space for new ones.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Remove anything that's bothering you</em></strong></p>

    <p>This principle is too deep to be explained here, I will further explain it in later. However, this imperative has
        a simpler side to it, for it we need to understand why minimalist design principles were revolutionary. Let's
        say you needed to design a poster and the image you liked doesn't seem to fit. You could add more elements to
        enhance the design, or you could rethink everything: remove that picture and the reasons for the visual
        misalignment in the first place! Build something from the ground up instead of trying to improve existing
        elements. Don't clean your desk, throw everything into a box and keep 1 pencil and 1 lamp. A clean and ordered
        environment isn't enough, it must be a radical transformation for radical results, creativity is a response to
        change. You need to be able to look around in your room and see nothing at the same time, this will bore you and
        inspire creativity. Don't cope by saying that a messy room inspires creativity. I had that too and creativity
        arrived as I made my room inspiringly picturesque, hence I'm teaching you, so give it a try. I used to have a
        messy room for years too. Your environment dictates your reality and don't allow it to dictate it negatively.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>- Pressure and credibility</em></strong></p>

    <p>In March 2023 I wanted to find ideas for my upcoming YouTube channel and I did that. I wrote down 2 ideas and
        then the 3rd idea came: create a video on how to be more creative. I took my camera out right away and had to
        demonstrate everything I knew about creativity. I took the camera and created a recording of me writing in my
        notebook. In 7 minutes, I brainstormed 23 ideas and later 35, some of which still inspire me. For example, this
        text was written on 2.4.2023 in this notebook, but in a much less sophisticated way. If you get put to the test
        and are under pressure you are often able to perform much better than expected. Some get numbed by pressure, and
        others accelerate, so find it out for yourself. This principle is one of the principles I would have forgotten
        if I hadn't looked in my notebook. You don't need to fear active times of brainstorming, just do them. If you
        fail, simply restart. But visualize having a notebook filled with ideas collected over the span of years and
        expanded continuously. Getting successful isn't about 1 good idea, but 10,000.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Write down an idea as soon as you have it</em></strong></p>

    <p>You must run out of the shower, leave your girlfriend, wake up in the middle of the night, or stop writing a test
        in school if you get an idea. Interrupt the task you are doing, writing down an idea takes no more than 2
        minutes, this time is very well spent. During school tests, I often meditate (and I'm one of the brightest
        students, I will end 12th grade with 16) occasionally, I get valuable insights, and it's worth distracting
        myself with them. If there is an idea, a good one, and you miss writing it down, it may never come back again
        because the circumstances change constantly. Missing an idea is pain. Make it easier to write down ideas, by
        carrying a notebook at all times with you. Using your phone in this situation should be forgiven. </p>

    <p><strong><em>- Look at it a couple of times</em></strong></p>

    <p>How often did it happen that you ran into a problem and tried hard to solve it, unsuccessfully, but then, after
        coming back the solution became visibly screaming? You don't need to come back after 10 minutes of rest, you can
        also come back after 5 years, with a fundamentally transformed perspective. You aren't in a rush. For example,
        the document where I write down blog ideas gets updated permanently in irregular intervals. It's important not
        to read the things you have written down already because this will steal momentum: it will make you think that
        you have already written down everything there was to write. </p>

    <p>From October 2022 on I started to do pushups and pullups when I ran into an error message that I couldn't resolve
        right away while programming, I had little experience with programming and ChatGPT didn't exist and I had even
        less experience with pushups and pullups, even though I was already 15. I would sprint outside and do some
        pullups and pushups, even if my hands were freezing from the frozen paving stones. This physical activity
        relaxed my mind, it gave me another challenge and increased blood flow, which made me more awake again.
        Following this, I was able to elevate my pushup count from 5 with a high effort to 150 effortless pushups per
        day in sets of 50 and 50 pullups in sets of 10. </p>

    <h1><strong><u>3. Align your life</u></strong></h1>

    <p><strong><em>- Do sports regularly, eat healthily, and sleep well: prioritize Health</em></strong></p>

    <p>All tips get a massive boost if your body is aligned with your goal. <em>“Avoid sugary foods throughout the day”</em> is a
        phrase I heard years ago and it helped me a lot. Say aloud <em>“Never am I going to eat sugary foods throughout the
        day without an intent.”</em> Sometimes less is more and things need to be let go of. No, sugar isn't good for your
        brain. The World Health Organization recommends 20g of sugar per day, that's 1 apple. 1 apple and that's it.
        Other foods contain low concentrations of sugar already, most likely you are multiple times higher in sugar
        consumption than you are supposed to be. The average German eats 102g of sugar a day. No wonder the average
        person is far away from their potential. I admit, I am a lot stupider than designed, even now. After fixing my
        life I could increase my IQ by 30 points in 1 year and this improvement continued. You are a lot stupider than
        you are supposed to be because your health is aligned against you. Why is it sometimes too hard to focus,
        because of some will, trauma, or because you put harmful things into your body on a large scale? What you should
        eat and what not is very simple, ask yourself, did your grandparents eat it? Most of the food in the supermarket
        shouldn't even qualify as food, some chemicals don't have a name. Eat unprocessed single-ingredient foods or
        only foods where you know every ingredient by its name and meaning, this instantly disqualifies 80% of the
        supermarket “food” Eat nuts, eggs, butter, vegetables, fish, meat, Greek yogurt, cheese, long to cook grains,
        olive oil, and that's it. Don't be scared of butter to fry things and don't fear eating 100g of nuts per day.
        Avoid plastics if you want to help your health. If everything your senses encounter dictates your reality, why
        should that be different for everything you eat? I let go of noodles, junk food, and sweets and nothing was
        missing in my life. You don't need to eat those things on special occasions either, simply decline with respect
        or eat less. Remember what discipline is? Discipline is the skill of doing things against your cravings and its
        absence in critical moments shows its nonexistence. Elevate yourself.</p>

    <p>Do sports. If you want creativity, there is only one criterion that needs to be met: it must higher your
        pulse for 30 - 75 minutes. Weightlifting isn't too healthy but it elevates your pulse and clears your mind too.
        You must go to the gym and build muscle; I had none before the gym. As soon as you build enough muscle in 2
        years, don't try to expand further, instead focus on maintenance, which may require going to the gym only 2
        times per week. Running, biking, and swimming are all excellent. You need strength and cardio. If you have a
        rest day, you may want to go for a little run or walk. </p>

    <p>Sleep well and enough. Currently, I go to bed at 19:30 and get up at 3:45, often I wake up naturally. Those are
        officially 8 hours of sleep and I can tell you that if you want to prioritize your health, as you should, 8
        hours isn't enough. It takes time to fall asleep and it takes time to reach a deep sleeping phase, the time
        spent sleeping is only 80% - 95%, meaning, I should rather go to bed from 17:30 to 19:00. As soon as driving
        school ends, which finishes at 18:30, I will eat my 1500 calorie meal and go to be within 20 minutes, at 18:45.
        Like this, I will sleep every day like on weekend. It's not impossible for you either. What you are living for
        and who is in control of your life? My parents have no problem going to bed at 19:00. It doesn't make sense to
        prioritize work over sleep, because you work better, by a factor of 2 - 6, if you sleep well. After all, it
        becomes much easier to focus. The amount of work done doesn't depend on the time spent, but rather on the amount
        of focus. There is another sentence that I heard and which burned forever into my mind: the average person does
        2 hours of deep work in 10 hours they spent at work or preparing for it. That means, working from 4:00 to 6:00
        brings already more results than a full-time job. Sleep is not only good for your health; it also gives your
        mind time to process everything.</p>

    <p>Your health is your greatest asset, protect it and make it blossom. It must be your #1 priority. </p>

    <p><strong><em>- Intermittent fasting</em></strong></p>

    <p>Here is what my typical meal looks like, I had it at 18:30 yesterday. I ate 50g of butter, 100g of almonds, 200g
        of Chinese gooseberry (commonly referred to as “Kiwi”), an apple, 400g of vegetables in dumplings, and 4 eggs.
        That's almost 1800 calories. The body is using a lot of resources to digest it; therefore, it doesn't make sense
        to work after you have eaten something. Currently, it's 5:38 and I have been writing for 2 full hours. I am
        hungry, yet full of energy. Hunger simply constitutes readiness for new food, not that you are going to collapse
        in 10 minutes. Use the energy you have to do some work. My first meal will be at 9 or 10 and it will break the
        fast (breakfast). Being hungry is beneficial from another perspective too: it gives motivation and allows for
        instant high focus. If you get up early, and fast and don't even dare to look away from your work, you will have
        up to 4 hours of uninterrupted flow, the average person has 0 hours and before these optimizations, I would
        hardly get 2. Hunger means you are ready to hunt.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Condition creativity</em></strong></p>

    <p>Like with anything, you will have to focus. Your bed is for sleeping and your desk for working, the desk isn't
        for sleeping and the bed isn't for working. I know I am guilty of this too, it's 5:44 and I'm still in bed. You
        should have a place that inspires creativity, it could be as simple as your desk. This also means you need
        certain items to manifest creativity, for example, a central notebook exclusively to capture ideas. If you want
        to try out risky ideas, get a second notebook where you will be able to tear out pages. Get a notebook to
        collect and connect ideas, and get a second one to dispose of risky ideas.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Get your attention span to 5 minutes</em></strong></p>

    <p>A healthy biological attention span is around 5 minutes, and a healthy mental attention span is around 3 years.
        The mental attention span means, you can focus on the same project for years and the biological attention span
        means that you can stare at the clock for 5 minutes without thinking about anything else than the clock, this is
        the one I'm referring to right now. If your attention span is on a goldfish level, you will get crushed by a
        person with a 5-minute attention span. You already know what your attention span is corrupted by: technology.
        How to restore it? Cutting out technology entirely. You don't have to spend time on social media. Yes, I have
        YouTube and YouTube is technically social media. I watch YouTube on purpose and upload there on purpose as well,
        I don't waste time there anymore. Anymore. Other social media like TikTok or Instagram can be cut out 100%.
        Things like WhatsApp bring your conversations into a wheelchair. WhatsApp is supposed to be <em>“Do we meet today at
        5 at your house y/n?”</em> and the rest must be in person. A short attention span is the direct equivalent of being
        handicapped in a wheelchair, it will make it hard to move, and sometimes impossible. If there is something
        meaningful to say, write a letter or an electronic letter <em>“Email”</em> The email app is very minimalist, so this
        won't overstimulate you and it won't handicap your attention span. </p>

    <p>What are you lacking for your success? Is it knowledge, money, time, connections, or access? It's focus. If you
        are unable to sit down to find ideas because your mind keeps wandering, you've got a problem. </p>

    <p>I can calm you if you are still reading, it means you are ahead of 95% of people quitting after the first
        paragraph or not even attempting to read it. They have already lost because they didn't even try, but they are
        the ones needing it the most. Here is an extra tip to focus better, with instant results: refuse to look away
        physically.</p>

    <em><strong>
            <p>- Master universal thought</em></strong></p>

    <p>This guide seems to be touching every relevant area, how is it possible to think about everything? It can be
        practiced, with writing and programming. Writing and programming are similar. You construct a simple version of
        reality, stories, or programs. You don't need to write in large texts like this one, journaling in your notebook
        is enough. I have already written a dedicated text for it. An utterly different activity that improves this
        skill is planning. Plan every day for the next 2 weeks and you shall become a master planner.</p>

    <p>While writing these blogs in specific I think about many things and people at once. I think about my sister who
        needs to learn a lot more, about the crush I need to impress, about my grandmother I don't want to disappoint,
        about my future self being grateful for these assets built, and most of my thoughts go towards making these
        texts as useful and enjoyable as possible for you to learn. I know how to be more creative, so I'm sharing it.
        Often, I stumble upon a lesson I deem to be obvious, for example, the lesson on speed, which I recommend

    <h1><strong><u>4. Aligning your subconscious</u></strong></h1>

    <p>The following tips do not remove any handicaps, everything from here magnifies. It's a gift and strengthens the
        understanding of every other principle.</p>

    <em><strong>
            <p>- Purpose and goal</em></strong></p>

    <p>Purpose is the thing you keep constantly thinking about, it dictates your life. If suppressed, it causes physical
        and mental sickness. Purposes come step by step. For a while, my apps used to be my purpose, and I kept thinking
        about them all the time. Because of that, it was very easy to find ideas related to them, because I aligned my
        subconscious with it. I kept saying to myself <em>“How do I get rich, how do I get rich, and how do I get rich”</em> and
        my subconscious mind started to get creative. As this purpose of apps, which I aligned my life to ended, the
        stream of ideas ran dry, and the reverse applies too. </p>


    <em><strong>
            <p>- Free your mind from stress, worries, insecurities and trauma</em></strong></p>

    <p>
        I have written multiple texts on how to do that:<br><br>
        How to fix traumas: <br> <a href="blog_63.html">“Move on”</a> 2100 words <br>
        Full mental health guide: <br> <a href="blog_77.html">“Negatives of the mind”</a> 8900 words<br>
        Refuse to think a thought: <br><a href="blog_88.html">“The power of the will is stronger”</a> 1400 words<br>
        Reduce stress: <br> <a href="blog_66.html">“Uncertainty”</a> 900 words<br>
    </p>

    <p>If your mind is misaligned with your goals, it needs to be fixed for further progress to be made. Otherwise, it
        will be difficult for your mind to be free of constraints, unleashing your potential. If you think you can't do
        it, you won't do it. If there is something else bothering you constantly it needs to be resolved. Remember that
        you are in control of your mind. You can refuse to think thought.</p>

    <p>In principle, a crush is similar to trauma, as it also occupies large amounts of your mind. But, methods of
        stress and trauma reduction, insecurities, and mental health fail here. I would even say, that this is a
        positive addition, rather than a negative one. </p>

    <h1><strong><u>5. Overcoming creative blocks spiritually</u></strong></h1>

    <p>There is a general rule that reads beautifully. You get what you deserve, the extraordinary doesn't hide in the
        ordinary, and doing things as everyone creates according to results. </p>

    <p>If you get up at 4:00 (now I have been writing for a while and it's 7:44, I still haven't eaten anything or taken
        a break from writing), work as hard as you can, walk for 12 km, go to the gym for 1 hour, where you run for
        additional 3 km together with an intense workout, read consistently, meditate, stay disciplined at all times,
        show brutal competence in all areas, that's the result you are going to get. I want to propagate this lifestyle
        to you, it will take years to reach, but I would never want to go back. I understand if you read it and feel
        slightly agitated by it. Trust me, you will get ready soon and then I'm going to need to fear what kind of texts
        you are going to write ;-)</p>

    <em><strong>
            <p>- Creativity, a reaction to chaos</em></strong></p>

    <p>Creativity is always induced; it's based on change. If something is changing, new adaptations are required, as a
        result, new perspectives emerge and new thoughts and thinking patterns emerge. This can be as simple as
        furniture changing its place, or a walk changing its route and time. There was a fundamental difference between
        going for walks at 5:00 or at 17:00, to provide an example. I often change my furniture's layout to further my
        creativity. I took a break from going for walks (this used to be text #91, but now it got enclaved, eaten by
        this bigger one)</p>

    <p><em>Routine and discipline kill creativity: <strong>Walking for the last time</strong></em></p>

    <p>I would go for a 1-hour walk in the golden light from the dawn at 5 in the morning and 12 hours later again for 2
        hours. This spiked my creativity and gave me time to think. I used to think texts through before I wrote them
        down moments later or think about new ideas for my businesses. It gave enough eye-pleasing ambient moments to
        capture, contributing to my aesthetic sense. In the beginning, walks made a huge contribution to my creativity,
        yet slowly it began to fade. The oasis of ideas ran dry since it became habitual. Creativity declines with
        repetition, as creativity is novelty paired with utility.</p>

    <p>I used to go for walks when I felt like it, and it yielded results. It became a stable replacement for watching
        YouTube, it too provided sensory input and a relaxed calming atmosphere. As I gained discipline and started to
        go for walks counter to my will or the weather, the creative part dried up. Instead of exploring new regions, it
        started to feel like a chore. Discipline helped me to go for walks during rain and to experience those facets,
        but eventually, this discipline killed any further progress. That means, categoric discipline accelerated at the
        beginning and slowed down quietly later on.</p>

    <p>Perhaps, it's time to take a break to regain new momentum. I tried to shortcut this process by using my bike to
        go for walks, true to the motto: <em>“Moving faster will help you to see more”</em> It didn't work, after going for walks
        from May to October, the benefits started to decline perceptibly at the end of August. There are no shortcuts,
        there is just reality and you.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There has to be change for new inspiration. Discipline and routine will help with creativity, but eventually kill
        it, because discipline and routine are order. Too much order isn't sustainable.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- Hobbies?</em></strong></p>

    <p>If hobbies become habitual, the change disappears, therefore, as soon as hobbies become habitually tied to work,
        like in the scenario of working and then walking, you need to rest from your hobbies in the same way. If you
        aren't fully present in your hobbies and keep thinking about your business at that time, hobbies are useless too
        and you may as well keep working, you don't need creativity, you need to cash out on your ideas before you try
        to get new ones. As you can see in the example of walks, photography, walking, finding ideas, biking, and
        working got mentally, habitually, and emotionally tied together, and no clear separation took place: that means,
        the resting/inspiration period disappeared. If that happens you simply need to change spiritually. </p>


    <p><strong><em>- The power of new purpose</em></strong></p>

    <p>If your purpose changes, it transforms every aspect of your life, and your creativity will skyrocket. Change in
        general is key to creativity. I saw a massive spike in creativity in the Winter/Spring of 2023, as I got rid of
        any remaining bad habits and started to fine-tune my life. </p>

    <p><strong><em>- Monk mode</em></strong></p>

    <p>Sometimes, like now, as I'm writing this text, everything gets too much and I need a reset, I need to rest from
        everything. For the next few weeks or months, I will dispose of anything spiking the motivation neurotransmitter
        dopamine, anything constituting excessive comfort or any pleasure higher than an apple. I got rid of sweets,
        sugar, tea, warm water, music, light, books, reading, WhatsApp, YouTube videos, and any form of pleasure,
        stimulation, or input in general. This needs to be combined with discipline only seen in prisons or the
        military. Discipline will help to stick to it refuse excessive comfort and input and reset the baseline. My
        longest monk mode period lasted around 3 months and, the radical variant for 10 days. The effects were immense
        for example, this blog, visible months later as well.</p>

    <p>This period of absolute denial and discipline will give your mind time to sort things out, it will reset your
        baseline. In itself, it is change too, and change creates creativity and inspiration. After less than a week of
        monk mode, I wrote around 10,000 words. Monk mode also provides other benefits such as great productivity and
        well-being, better health and sleep, greater presence and focus and it allows you to learn what's authentic and
        what isn't.</p>

    <p><strong><em>- The power of God</em></strong></p>

    <p>To change your thoughts, you need to change your language. Currently, I'm trying to get less arrogant. This means
        I had to rewrite multiple passages, for instance: <em>“Don't cope by saying that a messy room inspires creativity. I
        am more creative than you, hence I'm teaching you, so give it a try.”</em> Had to be rewritten to <em>“Don't cope by
        saying that a messy room inspires creativity. I had that too and creativity arrived as I made my room
        inspiringly picturesque, hence I'm teaching you, so give it a try.”</em> By paying attention to what you say and
        think you can build great leverage. By controlling what you think and say, you are able to make a real
        difference. Have faith in finding new ideas. </p>

    <h1><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></h1>

    <p>Every time I write such a text, I am scared of my creativity declining and my stream of ideas running dry.
        However, after a while, creativity always returns… </p>

    <p>Eventually, you will get to your creative peak and will feel depressed afterward. There is unfortunately nothing
        you can do about it you won't ever be able to go back. Be grateful for that peak instead, because most people
        never have one. Enjoy the peak, you will feel when it's there, don't assume it's now.</p>

    <p>Today I got up at 3:30 and I have written this text until now, 9:45 for more than 6 hours. I emptied my mind
        again and got creative, in a permanent flow state. I didn't need a single break in these 6 hours, because
        writing itself can be the break, creativity is all about change. After a few years of practicing, you will be
        able to get to the same level or an even higher one. Now, for the rest of the day, I will continue with my monk
        mode and meditate. I may eat something and while meditating I will be simply happy and grateful for how far I
        have gotten, how much there is to learn, and how grateful I need to be for the chance of teaching this to you.
        Thank you. </p>

    <p>Now, whether you are going to implement this guide or not, is your choice. Maybe return to it in a few months and
        see what has changed.</p>
