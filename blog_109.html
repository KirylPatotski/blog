    <h1>A new identity</h1>

    <p>So, what have I been procrastinating with again? Maybe it's tied to my projects, <em>her</em>*, or some new
        endeavor I
        envisioned by staring at the ceiling. I'm confessing that considering my past texts tempts you to assume such,
        and Gentlemen! My newest exertion is not related to anything that can be found in my contemporary text, as it's
        tied to my past, to an identity I subtracted and now it's resurfacing. I don't like it and if I think about it
        further, I'm not certain if I dislike it or not. Let me introduce you to the conflict I'm facing and it's
        perhaps the most influential uncertainty I will ever face. </p>

    <p>Let me paint a picture. In December 2020 I started to learn how to program because my mother assumed I would
        enjoy it and that's what I did. It gave me something more or less meaningful to work on and the future looked
        bright. While programming I could enter a flow with ease and felt fulfillment while doing so. After putting in
        further effort and learning real programming from July 2021 to April 2022 I got to know my true edge and moved
        far beyond it. The programming course was hard, every second of it, whether it was listening or the homework
        itself. In fact, for me it was too difficult, I didn't pass the exam in March 2022. However, just because it was
        hard and I partially gave up in the second half of the course, it didn't mean that it was useless or that I
        didn't learn anything. Well actually, I learned nothing concrete, I remember not a single lesson anymore and it
        doesn't matter. What I did is priceless. I learned how to learn and I learned how to perform under pressure.
        This programming course pressured me, it's the only thing I can remember from this period, I remember only
        darkness and some fragmented memories from school, and in parallel, I transitioned from 8th to 10th grade. I
        didn't do anything outside of programming. My mother forced me to go to swimming class and I felt disgusted by
        it, so, not only did I have multiple sources of pressure, but the pressure rose even more because the area got
        smaller, my mother subtracted time by forcing me to go to swimming class for 1 hour a week. One hour a week
        doesn't sound like much, but effectively it's equal to 4 hours because you interrupt a flow and also need to get
        ready and then you also need to rest afterward because I wasn't used to physical activity. And 4 hours a week
        robbed is a lot worse when you are under pressure. I think, my mother would enjoy having 4 extra hours a week.
        The last thing I worried about was social affairs. I had no friends, no social skills and, you may have guessed
        it, no interest in girls. When I entered 10th grade as a new student, I was shocked that no one came to me to
        talk, I thought that it would be like in 5th grade where everyone is curious. Hence, I spend my time on the
        calculator during the breaks or learning Chinese. I only had a rough vision, which resembles close similarities
        to today and I had set up everything to go its way to end up at my desires. After the programming course ended
        in April 2022, I was still in 10th grade, and now I need to brag a bit, I was 14 years old and got sick of
        programming. Instead of programming, I spend my time creating videos for YouTube. In 60 days, I created 375
        shorts and gained close to 1,000 subscribers and over half a million views. In retrospect, I created rather
        silly videos. For example, I created videos, where I would drop LEGO cars and record them breaking in slow
        motion or I would create videos of water in slow motion. Then, I gave up on that and committed fully to my app,
        which I started to pursue.</p>

    <p>At that time, I had similar attitudes towards things, which means, the energy of my past and current self is
        similar. Yet, we would not be friends, because our identities have shifted entirely and now conflict in many
        areas. As a 14-year-old, I remember how I spent time on my calculator, yet now I don't care about math, numbers,
        or algorithms. I was for technology, yet now I don't even use warm water. My current and past identities have
        something in common: they are interested in words—one in words that do, expressed through programming, and my
        current self in words that teach. Similarly, the videos from the past, show and entertain while my current
        videos reflect and explain. So, on paper, I'm the same person as two years ago, yet in reality, everything
        beyond the surface shifted. So, that means this text is a very deep conflict I have inside myself and one text
        where I reflect won't be enough in any case. </p>

    <p>The second thing this outline showed is that whenever I got tired of programming, I would focus on YouTube, a
        cycle so to speak. Yet, I don't know if I have got enough of programming once and for all. Because I fully
        changed as a person, as I will explain now…</p>

    <p>The real story only starts in April 2022, after the break I used for YouTube. I started to give it all to
        programming. I started to work on my app, a mental math app with games. I worked harder than I ever did or will
        ever again, I remember how in the summer holidays of 2022 I would work extremely hard for 7 days, then get sick
        in the 5-day voyage to Rome, then return for 7 days and get sick again and then spending my time working while
        sick in the two-week vacation in Bulgaria for me to have a working prototype by August 2022 published. It only
        got more intense, as I improved my productivity further and built further skills. If I would have written a text
        at that time, you would have seen how damaged my personality was. I have no idea how you would otherwise develop
        such great of a desire. I can't explain how I was able to keep going with 14-hour days of programming for so
        long. </p>

    <p>Programming is no joke. Every second of it is hard and every second of it is damaging to your mental well-being,
        programmers regularly burn out or go insane. I want to describe what programming feels like. Firstly, you get
        presented with a problem or you have to think of one yourself, or the worst situation is you have to discover an
        error that needs to be fixed. You are confused, even if experienced, and need to be in that deep-thinking phase
        all the time because problems never repeat. If problems repeat, they aren't problems. Then, you try out
        different approaches and none of them work and you have no idea why they don't work. You couldn't ask ChatGPT,
        it didn't exist back then. You try over and over again and eventually, you find a solution that half-works. Yet,
        then you try it out further and the program dies for no obvious reason, or it creates weird behavior. So, you
        start perhaps all over again. Eventually, you figure the solution out and realize that you need to solve
        thousands of problems like these to build something useful. You also don't learn anything, because this problem
        will never return, that's why the fulfillment you gain in the end is very short and small. If you solve one
        problem, there will be infinitely more waiting. Some will be waiting like land mines, in the most random places
        at the most random times. Programming is so damaging to your mental well-being that it's no wonder no decent
        woman desires a programmer. </p>

    <p>I kept going with increasing productivity and still with a damaged mind. I kept working on my app, I constructed
        my life around it. Then, in December 2022 things started to change. I started to resolve my traumas, I started
        to break free from the internet (yes, through programming, I also developed a dislike for apps) and I started to
        socialize for the first time. However, everything went slowly in the beginning and my life would continue with
        little change until June 2023. I did change a lot in that time, I improved my social skills further, I
        subtracted traumas and bad habits, I started going to the gym, I started my current YouTube channel, I got a
        crush on a girl - yet everything had still its place, I programmed and kept working on my apps, just with some
        lifestyle changes. Yet, during my burnout, I stopped programming and started to write. In August 2023, I had two
        internships and I enjoyed them not particularly. You see, I was only able to keep going with my programming,
        with my working on my apps, because I did it for me, I cared about it. Hence, the reward was much bigger, yet
        struggling for someone else didn't appeal to me, at least not to the level that programming is suffering. In
        September 2023 my app, which I started in April 2022, failed finally and I abandoned programming since then.
    </p>

    <p>I thought until recently, that I just needed a break from programming, just like in spring 2022 and 2021. Yet,
        now 6 months passed since my burnout and I still haven't returned to programming. I think, programming no longer
        matches who I am. I'm not a nerd anymore.</p>

    <p>You see, an identity dictates who you are and how you want to be perceived. It dictates what makes you feel well
        and what brings discomfort and establishes what kind of discomfort is endurable or expected. It provides a
        baseline to fall back to and sets up your entire life. Changing an identity is vital to change externally. </p>

    <p>And this, that's the conflict. It's a conflict between my older self and the perception my parents have of me.
        It's not that I can't change my identity, it's rather that I've already changed it and now I don't know if the
        task of programming is compatible with my new one. I'm excellent in programming, do not misunderstand me. It's
        just that I realized, that I may never return to programming and perhaps I do not want to spend my life living
        this way. My parents are going to think of me as a failure, in their eyes YouTube and writing are nonsense. </p>

    <p>Now I'm a philosopher.</p>

    <p>From June 2024 to October 2024 there is no school, 12th grade ends a few days just 6 days after my 17th birthday
        (that means, if 12th grade ended a week before, I could say that I finished school at 16. But, to simplify
        things and to make it sound more dramatic, I will still spread the lie that I finished school at 16, come on,
        treat me!) and my parents want me to do an internship at some company in that period. </p>

    <p>But I don't. </p>

    <p>I think I've changed too much; I've let go of the identity of a programmer. Now the last remains fade slowly away
        and they will never come back.</p>

    <p>As recently as December 2023, I participated in a coding competition and I noticed that I didn't enjoy it. </p>

    <p>No wonder I find it mentally very draining to apply to university and to those internships. I think an internship
        would be one of the worst situations to be in. I will never have 4 free months in my life again. My time would
        be much better spent figuring out who I am.</p>

    <p>Am I strong enough to be called a failure by my parents for thinking so? Yes. They are correct if they say that
        it's a waste of time because it is in the short run. However, I think the price of wasting my time in an
        internship I'm likely to learn nothing is too expensive. You don't learn anything in those internships and jobs,
        you simply get milked with what you already can. Should I still apply? Yes, because it's about having options.
        If this text is correct, I can still write a letter to explain my situation. Although I'm not sure here either,
        because who says that I will be unable to have an internship at the side, while in university? The 4 months of
        learning on my own, with a delayed immense return on investment would be gone if I did so. To counter this
        argument, one could also say that I would program at this time anyway, yet this could be untrue. To provide
        another argument against that internship is that I would not get time to work on myself with high intensity, by
        reading all day long and extracting all of the wisdom to accelerate in life. </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Notes from 6.1.2023. I had a terrible week, a start-of-the-life crisis. Some optimism would envision a bettering,
        but I also know that pragmatism establishes itself down the stream of time, hence I don't think that the next
        week is going uphill.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The first company I applied to rejected me (well, if they were only to read my blog!) and I feel indifferent
        towards it. Yet, now this crisis is going to continue. I find always more and more joy in writing and videos. I
        notice how much I suffer without them. From the perspective of the Tao, I should not resist too much, I must not
        do what would make my life meaningless. Yet, do you know what this story makes clear? It teaches how important
        it is to be strong and capable. You can't wish to desire to be in a situation where you would be forced to do
        what you despise, I don't wish anyone a life where their highest pleasure is coming home from work because they
        hate it so much, to a family that resents them. This story confirms a rather romantic version of life, one where
        excellence is the highest virtue. Because, no matter what you are excellent at, if you excel, you will be safe.
        If I excel at writing, I will be able to live a life where I do work that gives me joy and with enough
        excellence even rich. Let this story be a reminder to strive for excellence.</p>

    <p>This story also reminds us how vital authenticity is. I can't imagine myself living an ordinary life. A life,
        where you have mediocrity everywhere and where the largest pleasure is talking about your empty life with
        shallow friends on a Friday evening. I would find such a life too inauthentic to be worth living. Now I
        understand what Nihilism is. There is something inside of many people especially inside of me. It's the desire
        for greatness. Even living this monk lifestyle where you get rid of desires seems to be better than the shallow
        life of an unfulfilling job that you take because it pays well. I sort of don't care if someone responds to this
        text that “I should wake up and stop being a little idealistic child,” because most likely those adults have
        nothing in common with me. </p>

    <p>You choose the kind of suffering you want. I don't want the kind of suffering that comes from a lack of meaning
        caused by a deficiency of authenticity.</p>

    <p>I don't know what I've done with this reflection. I've contradicted everything I wrote because I changed too
        much. Change needs to be approached with humility because it's better to adapt early, otherwise one will not
        only have failed to predict the feminine but also failed to adapt.</p>

    <p>So, now I don't know what's next. </p>

    <p>(Partially added on January 8th and January 11th)</p>

    <p>*I found it pleasing to see her sit upright, no matter if she will be mine or not. I hope she keeps working on
        herself. However, if she or any girl wants to be mine, I think it's better if they come closer to my level of
        progress, especially in matters of handling modern technology. And it's not as if the <a
            href="blog_95.html">negative effects of internet usage</a> are something secret. They/she must also break
        free from any male friends, especially if those are losers. I don't know what to think if I see this girl with
        an absolute loser in every area like I did on Tuesday the 9th. You may try to cope with some nonsense, but those
        things just hurt too much.
    </p>

    <p>To contradict what I've written a few days prior, I think the new forgivingness I wrote on January 1st about
        doesn't mean that I'm going to be a pushover, i.e. it has its limits. Independently of it, I've had an 11-hour
        screen time in the past 7 days, because I wasted a lot of time using the driving school app and this messaging
        app stuff. Despite having meaningful conversations, I still have to conclude that 11 hours of screen time is
        terrible for my mental well-being and productivity. Luckily, I'm not addicted to this crap anymore and should
        have no problems letting go to reach a 0 - 5 minute screen time.</p>

    <p>On Wednesday, the 10th of January 2024, I've made a decision. I was sitting in English class and we were talking
        about matters related to jobs. It was at this moment that I decided that I would not pursue internships and that
        I would talk with my parents about it. That's what I did after I got home, I told my mother, “I won't apply to
        any internship, I don't see what this has to do with my future.” So, I eliminated this crap from my life and
        felt just fine. You see, discussing it would have been the approach of a rather feminine person, as it would
        imply that you are uncertain. If you are uncertain, it makes sense for others to influence you. Yet, not if you
        say that you've made a decision. You can observe this kind of behavior everywhere. I asked my mother if I was to
        go to a mountain in the middle of the night and she rejected it. Yet, now I do things like that on an almost
        daily basis, and never have I heard a complaint, except that 'I should take my phone with me.' Furthermore,
        after I wrote this reflection, I realized just how much I genuinely hate technology. I think I need more time to
        pass. </p>

    <p>I also observed how negative the effect of this whole application process was. It killed my consciousness and now
        I'm desperately trying to restore it. I feel as if I died mentally. Now one hour feels as if it only lasts 5
        minutes, hence my productivity was zero in the past two weeks. Meditation will help, but it's going to take a
        bit longer, and it genuinely worries me, I've never been less mindful.</p>

    <p>The necklace from September, I've lost it somewhere and I don't know it's symbolic meaning. Perhaps, it's because
        I've been completely mindless. </p>
