    <h1>One thing...</h1>

    <p>In 2020, or rather early 2021 I faced an important decision that would shape the following years. As I started to
        learn how to code at the age of 13 at the end of 2020, it was clear that I was going to become an entrepreneur,
        it was also certain, that I would create customer-based products, meaning not something for other businesses or
        for the government, but for ordinary people. So, I had 2 options. Either, I specialize in web development or in
        app development. </p>

    <p>Web development has some massive advantages. For one, it has the potential to reach more people faster, it's
        self-reliant, there are more options, all internet companies started as websites, it is better scalable, there
        are more web developers available, you can optimize the visibility of a website, it's easier to update and it's
        centralized, …</p>

    <p>Mobile development has massive advantages too. It feels better to use, it's easier to monetize, and it's more
        personal for the users, habit formation is easier, it can drive engagement via notifications, Android developers
        make more money, and it can be used offline …</p>

    <p>So, why did I pick Android development over web development? It's something so silly and small: if you press a
        button on a website, you get that disgusting 1500-millisecond delay, while the app reacts in no less than 50
        milliseconds. Such a small thing, literally a second, determined a considerable chunk of my future. </p>

    <p>Now you may be hesitating to think that this applies to everything. No, always, it's some “insignificant” detail
        that's making the difference. This detail shapes the rest, then your mind tries to justify your emotional flash
        with rationality. “Well, actually app development is better suited for my goal, because … I could use a website;
        however, I don't think that's right in my situation” </p>

    <p>That's also the key to sales, as sales are the process of showing such a simple thing that's determining the
        rest. Someone may say: “This house has a nice and quiet location and has the right layout and the rooms seem
        comfortable. We should take this one” While the real reason may be: “There is a blossoming cherry tree outside
        the kitchen window, when I cook, I see it every day.”
        <br>Determining what house to move into is a huge decision. However, any decision is shaped by such a
        <em>micro-moment.</em>
    </p>

    <p>Decisions are unless explicitly thought about with no prior knowledge, made emotionally and justified logically.
        Especially if all options are similar, it's one micro difference making the change. If I never used a phone or
        the internet, I wouldn't have this bias and may have chosen different, from a purely logical perspective, but
        those scenarios don't exist.</p>

    <p>However, if this delay of 1500 milliseconds got removed in websites, I wouldn't re-decide, because the preference
        was already built, and the irrational core, here these 1500 milliseconds, would be replaced by something else
        instantly because the other massive advantages remain unchanged, meaning, this emotional micro-moment was just a
        spark between 2 equal campfires, igniting one of them, which then becomes the right one. </p>

    <p>What does it mean? Show you the truth, and the true self, because there is likely to be a blossoming cherry tree
        making the difference. </p>
