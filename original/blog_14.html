    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Using split tests to test old and common knowledge</span></h1>
    <h1>Let's try it out!</h1>

    <p>These images were updated on May 27th 2023, because the previous images were not so great.</p>
    <div class="gallery">
        <img src="images/split_test/old/1.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/old/2.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/old/3.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/old/4.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/old/5.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/old/6.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/old/7.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/default/default backgound.jpg">
    </div>


    <p>Every image shows a unique problem that they solve and are supposed to remove any doubt from the user.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The first image shows what benefit the user is going to get by using this app. It gives the app a purpose
            and a mission</li>
        <li>The second image shows the biggest obstacle that the user may have, too little motivation. Coincidentally,
            that's exactly what my app is good at because the app has been built with motivation as a central aspect.
        </li>
        <li>Instead of blaming the user for results, the third image indicates that you will see progress and
            improvement if you try hard enough.</li>
        <li>Another thing that is motivational about my app is the integration of 6 mini-games that are supposed to make
            math a little more fun.</li>
        <li>You can learn at your own pace and make progress according to your desires.</li>
        <li>This image shows, what you'll be able to solve better or what you will learn to improve better.</li>
        <li>The final image shows that the app tries to be not monotone.</li>
        <li><em>This image is a filler, and not visible on Google Play, but the layout of this website forced me to use
                it.</em></li>
    </ol>

    <p>I myself am happy with this design, although, for example, some screenshots don't match the screens anymore,
        especially in the game category. If someone installs the app, then the design is always the most common
        compliment I get. This is, in reality, the biggest problem I'm facing right now, because, maybe the designs are
        great, but simply not enough time has passed to really test them. But, since I have little to lose (I will still
        be able to change the <a href="blog_2.html">designs</a> back later), I will try to create new designs,
        displaying the features instead of
        the problems. I'm doing this, because my app has a very small conversion rate of just 20%, instead of the common
        50% conversion rate, as of June 2023.</p>

    <p>I don't know if you fully understand why this experiment is extremely important. In marketing, sales, and
        business, you always have to start with the problems and not the features, that's what every professor and book
        is going to tell you. But, if my findings contradict this knowledge, by increasing the conversion rate well
        above 20%, this whole foundation shatters and renders common business knowledge useless, or at least out of
        date.</p>


    <p><em>Let's get started</em></p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="item">
            <img src="images/split_test/default/Screenshot 2023-06-18 102411.jpg">
            <div class="tooltip">I started by recording a bunch of screenshots</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>After I created a bunch of new screenshots, I started uploading them to Google Drive and then to Canva and
        started editing.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="item">
            <img src="images/split_test/default/desing.gif">
            <div class="tooltip">Here you can see me creating a new project</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>I turned off any internet, closed any programs, and started working completely without distractions until I was
        done.</p>
    <p>But then, a problem arose: the new designs were still too full of problems that they are trying to solve, and not
        entirely focused on features. I scraped everything and started from scratch, this time only by selecting a few
        screenshots. That's why it only took additional 10 minutes.</p>

    <div class="gallery">
        <img src="images/split_test/new/1.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/new/2.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/new/3.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/new/4.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/new/5.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/new/6.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/new/7.png">
        <img src="images/split_test/new/8.png">
    </div>

    <p>The new "designs" completely ignore the mission, goal, and purpose and they don't tell what problems they solve,
        so now, my images are just like images of any other app. I don't know what's going to happen to the conversion
        rate on Google Play, but I will give it a month's time. Until then, I won't write anything else in this blog (in
        this specific blog), because it would be too early to judge. See you then! If you don't want to miss the update,
        I recommend you bookmark this page.</p>

    <p>Appendix from 4.10.2023</p>
    <p>
        This experiment failed, because how could I test it if no one sees the store listing to begin with? If 10
        people/month see it, then a conversion rate of 10% is useless, considering that most users get lost anyway.
        Furthermore, my first app died as a whole because of its concept, and this was therefore useless in my case (you
        may still need to try it out yourself, if that's relevant for you). The concept was wrong altogether, because I
        build the app without validating it prior. Read more in the story “<a href="blog_64.html">The Final Battle</a>”
