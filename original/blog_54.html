    <p>For each question, you have a limit of 200 words. These questions are the original questions and good luck!</p>


    <ol>
        <li>Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a diverse student body. How will the life
            experiences that shape who you are today enable you to contribute to Harvard?</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Briefly describe an intellectual experience that was important to you.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment experience, travel, or family
            responsibilities that have shaped who you are. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future? </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Top 3 things your roommates might like to know about you.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I don't know how I would answer these questions myself in a interesting way, so I won't write my responses here for now. But, if I find interesting answers, I will update this blog.</p>
