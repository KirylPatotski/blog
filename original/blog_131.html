    <h1>Love is the center</h1>

    <p>As you may know, I create videos on self-improvement. Of the plentiful comments that compliment me, a few bother
        me. Usually, it's hard to offend me. I tried to think of the best way to respond to these haters and discovered
        that love is the most important thing in my life. Nevertheless, the path there was quite interesting and a
        lesson worth sharing. </p>

    <p>Maybe, the internet is a toxic place and I should never read comments. Or perhaps I could read comments and
        occasionally respond to the positive ones. I usually never get offended by anything; I simply don't care if
        someone disagrees since my principles helped me and I deeply believe they can help you as well. Most likely it's
        best to just ignore what offends you without cleaning your soul. It's a waste of time, energy, mental health,
        and spirit trying to engage, I can't even know if that's a real person. Everyone will keep their opinions
        anyway, and no hater will smash that like and subscribe button. Negative comments will be forgotten by history.
        There will be some random blue-haired, broke, 40-year-old, never doing anything worth mentioning, who will
        comment: 'You are 16 and need to learn a lot, by the way, you're autistic so shut up.' Side note here, if she's
        so smart, why doesn't she demonstrate the potency of her lessons? </p>

    <p>I mean what I say and say what I mean. I would bet I constructed a much greater life than she did in her 40 years
        if her only hobby is to write comments. Unfortunately reminding myself of my progress in every area of life
        relative to a random hater didn't help. Somehow, I couldn't cope by reminding myself how great I am, where I
        started, and where I am right now, and how jealous she must have been seeing a 16-year-old trying and thus
        invalidating all excuses. Something about these hate comments annoyed me. I couldn't figure out what it was. I
        know that I'm ahead, they are jealous, I can just delete these comments or not read them, and normally I don't
        care about anything… Something was still bothering me… </p>

    <p>Normally I'm a master at ignoring, not caring, being authentic, and resisting peer pressure. I have a few tips to
        stop caring. Firstly, realize that everyone is just as lost as you are, no one has a true clue about anything,
        and everyone will be forgotten. Even if you are a loser yourself, caring too much about what other losers think
        won't lead you anywhere. Some people want to win, others want to blend in. I didn't care what anyone thought of
        me when I didn't make my hair, stuttered, and went to the new grade, jumping from 8th to 10th. Neither did I
        care the first time I went to the club a week ago and was the first one on the dancefloor while being sober. I
        don't care about anything that is not truly important, which only a few things are. Focus on the things that are
        important first. You have to realize that you can care about a limited number of things. Simply practice doing
        important things and get in the habit of breaking free. But still, something made my methods fail and I kept
        wondering why, what was the universe trying to tell me?</p>

    <p>Then it hit me. </p>

    <p>I realized that the answer to this hate was love. To be clear, I don't mean that you should love the person who
        spreads negativity. You see, would you bother if a useless person hated you if you had it all? Would you, and I
        hate to be superficial here, sit in your private jet and care about what a demon has to say? If you don't obsess
        over private jets, visualize yourself on a yacht. If you had your hot blonde girl, and a strong brotherhood who
        would be telling you how right you are, would you care? Would you truly care if you had it all?</p>

    <p>That's even why I have zero empathy myself! Everyone is after all responsible for his life and I have to live in
        fight mode at all times because I'm alone. Maybe I'm just not very likable because I haven't developed enough.
        Certainly, I don't like others enough. Of course, I'm going to feel danger from someone's not personal only half
        negative exaggerated comment if I'm alone and essentially helpless. </p>

    <p>Here comes another twist. Why try hard to be proud of oneself? For love as well, nothing more, nothing less.
        Either out of love, to others, to God, or even to oneself, or to gain love. The desire for love, here also in
        the romantic kind, is what kept me going for a long time already and I wasn't truly aware thereof. Love is at
        the center of life, truly.</p>

    <p>Power is the ability to let things go your way. Power can mean tiger, but power can also mean simply not caring.
        The tiger does not care about the paper version of his. If love is at the core of not caring what some random
        paper tiger has to say, deductively, love is power and strength. I believe that love and power are two sides of
        the same coin, otherwise, I wouldn't be pushing so hard with everything I touch. The love of a powerful person
        is much more valuable simply for the reason of what kind of person you have to become. That means, caring about
        things too much comes from helplessness, quiet despair. </p>

    <p>Empathy, sympathy, and compassion are all expressions of love, so isn't a lack thereof bad? Not quite. Here is my
        view on it. Even if I was loved so much I would want to take a break, I still wouldn't care about a random
        stranger's suffering. Empathy should be kept to people close to one. Keep your circle small and only your
        influence large. If someone close to me was to cry, I wouldn't think 'You're useless and a complete loser',
        instead, I would cheer them up. </p>

    <p>Rarely do I care about strangers. Why should I? There are only a few moments where I care about a stranger's
        suffering. There's a guy I have known since early childhood and he has a nonexistent self-esteem. I haven't
        spoken to him in years, yet sometimes I see him and he, it appears stagnates in life. I know that he didn't have
        it easy and I think to myself, may God bless him. Yet still, the responsibility is his, and the choice is his as
        well. I indeed feel nothing for the person that I don't know who wastes his life and shows weakness, more so if
        I've been through it myself, but man, … I understand that sometimes bad things happen not because - but just.
