        content="If you have enough motivation and fix your life, you will realize that you never wanted to have free time in the first place. Free time is supposedly desired, if you work for someone else, meaning you lack motivation, but that's not true, because leisure time is actually the worst time of the day.">

    <h1>What to wear and what to cook</h1>

    <p>The title hooked you, didn't it? But this text is not about how to be a good wife, rather it's about ruthlessly
        outcompeting everyone with ease. This text will provide you with a key to productivity and also, you'll be
        convinced that “what to wear and what to cook” are poisonous questions. It absolutely matters what you or
        someone else cooks or wears, that's because your food is one of the many keys to your health and productivity
        and your appearance to your status. But the <em>questions</em> are the problem.</p>

    <p>Let's imagine you have 100 points every morning after you have woken up. Every conscious decision drains 1 such
        point. That means if you wake up and decide what to wear, you have already wasted a point. If you then think for
        5 minutes about what to cook, you'll waste not only 1 point but most likely a couple of these points. Since the
        number of points per day is limited, you can't invest such a point in something important.</p>

    <p>Let's say, you wanted to get 120 of such decision points per day instead of 100. How would you do that? By
        improving your health. But if you have already optimized your health to its limit, there is also another way.
        The day starts the night before. If you write down an extensive plan, with times, durations, and tasks, you can
        shortcut the complicated decision-making process and save decision points the next day for the real tasks. For
        me, I didn't need to plan anything, because I knew the goal of the next day in advance. If you already planned
        everything, you will have a hard time procrastinating, because now you made yourself accountable. Most of the
        time during the day, you are most likely doing nothing useful, even if you don't have any bad habits. But still,
        micro-moments are wasting your energy and time to do real work. That's the reason it's hard to even do a single
        5-minute task regularly, like cleaning your room, creating a short video, or practicing talking. In December
        2022 I made the single decision to complete 5-minute tasks right away this year. What a powerful decision. </p>

    <p>Routines are extremely powerful because they skip the conscious decision part right away. You don't need to
        decide to brush your teeth, you do it automatically and therefore the task takes much less time - that's the
        power of habits.</p>

    <p>Let's put it differently. Why are you able to perform well under pressure? Because you know exactly what to do
        and don't hesitate and procrastinate with questions, you simply do it. </p>

    <p>Practical tips:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Set yourself the goal to complete 5-minute tasks right away, starting after you have read this.</li>
        <li>Plan, or at least imagine what you are going to do the next day, and keep yourself accountable.</li>
        <li>Answer the question of what to wear and what to cook fast. I recommend you cook the same things each day of
            the week and do the same things with clothes. </li>
        <li>If you waste time between tasks, it means, that you messed up in your planning because hesitation means
            insecurity. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Even though I wrote that it matters how you dress I would have disagreed for the first 15 years of my life,
        because of my general way of living: As I started to pursue entrepreneurship in 2020, I had nothing to
        demonstrate, no goals, no projects, no knowledge and no skills. I simply had to give my absolute best and not
        care about anything else. Only as I had some things to show, such as my YouTube channels, apps, victories, or
        even this blog, I started to care about my appearance, even though I still don't care too much. That is because
        if I had nothing there would be no point in trying to be something by caring about your appearance and there
        would be so much wasted productivity. I simply focused - I had a vision and a goal.</p>
