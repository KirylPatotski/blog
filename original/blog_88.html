    <h1>A method to control your mind</h1>

    <p>1. What's redundant won't happen</p>

    <p>Someone asked me recently to explain the story from August titled “Failures Kill” This story #50 is my favorite
        so far, and here is how it goes. I failed hard and a failure set stopped progress for 6 months. “Failures make
        us stronger”, as the average person would say. But after getting slapped in the face metaphorically many times
        over, I built up a lot of as a result and tried to resolve it and got slapped in the face even harder, this time
        I didn't care. Failures or too many significant setbacks didn't cause growth but rather showed that I lacked a
        foundation and failures kill, as they remove paths that were wrong all along. Failures can also paralyze and
        hinder growth altogether if there are too many significant ones at the same time. </p>

    <p>Why is it that you have never heard of this concept before, just like every person I talked to? “Failures are
        temporary setbacks that lead to growth in the long run” is a common perception and not “Failures show a missing
        foundation and remove paths that were wrong” </p>

    <p>I will provide you with alternative examples and the subsequent lesson you will need to understand will reveal
        itself in an instant. Every time I fake a conversation in my mind, it never happens. Never. A roughly comparable
        conversation may occur in real life, but not in the same shape as intended, no matter how often you spoke it
        through and considered alternative responses and new insights. Why does it seem to be the red pocket knife you
        had in your pocket made you never encounter a wild dangerous animal in the dark dense quiet forest again? </p>

    <p>The lesson learned from these examples I encountered is revealed here: What's redundant won't happen. </p>

    <p>This lesson is key to the understanding of the following technique to further expand control over your mind in a
        pushup type of conscious activity. I know this method to be powerful and hard at the same time, so that's why I
        rarely use it, however, it's important to note that you can live your whole life using this method, yet I have
        to warn of the dangers: it may only be used to get rid of redundant thoughts. Traumas, for instance, have to be
        resolved, and this method doesn't resolve anything, it rather trains your brain to build better thought
        patterns. </p>

    <p>2. Neuroplasticity</p>

    <p>Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize its structure and functions in response to
        intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli, especially after injuries like stroke or traumatic brain injury. It involves
        processes such as neuronal regeneration, functional reorganization, and mechanisms like synaptic plasticity and
        diaschisis. Simply put, it means, that the ends of the ends of the neurons, the nerve cells reconnect their
        ends, called synapses. Just like any effort, it can be practiced and improved, neural plasticity is mostly
        present while learning. Constant learning is not only necessary to outperform the other 95% but also to maintain
        your brain's health.</p>

    <p>Neurons are strongly connected, and mental processes used more frequently become more effortless to use, as a
        result, at the same time, changing these patterns becomes harder too. There is a more visual approach to it and
        in computer science it's called hardware acceleration. Instead of using a general processor, the computer has a
        graphics card too, as the graphics card is better at multiplying matrices than the more universal central
        processing unit (CPU), that's because the graphics card had been carefully designed to do these tasks,
        therefore, the graphics card isn't able to do the tasks of a CPU too well. A knife is more universal than a
        bread cutter. Neurons are designed to become stronger over time, like the bread cutter, which makes change more
        difficult. That means negative thoughts appear more frequently automatically. </p>

    <p>3. Operant conditioning</p>

    <p>Operant conditioning is the process of automating certain behaviors with the utilization of external or internal
        stimuli. Negative reinforcement is used to discourage a behavior and positive reinforcement is used to encourage
        some specific action. Positive reinforcement is regarded as the go-to approach, as it is proven to be more
        effective. </p>

    <p>If a thought pattern is more established altogether, by common repetition, it becomes easier to attach certain
        negative patterns to external stimuli, often it is going to bed or in my case going for walks.</p>

    <p>4. The method</p>

    <p>Here is how to gain more control of your mind. If a negative thought pops into your mind, it becomes redundant
        from a spiritual point of view (1), which means, you can ignore it. Further analyzing it may not lead to proper
        results, if further analysis yielded results, this reoccurring redundancy wouldn't appear, because it would get
        resolved. But, if a negative thought appears every day, you may let go of it. If a thought gets repeated often,
        you get a real problem, because neuroplasticity (2) made it significantly easier for this negativity to appear
        habitually (3), often within the same context. That means you need to refuse to think of a negative thought,
        after discarding it for a while repeatedly, which takes great effort, the habitual thoughts conditioned into
        your brain and strengthened by neuroplasticity need to be removed.</p>

    <p>If a negative thought appears, don't indulge in it. Instead, take a deep breath, stand upright, and (highly
        effective) do some pushups. This is called mindfulness and is a skill to put you into reality again, which can
        be practiced by meditation, it is highly similar. I started to pair the discard of negativity with some
        gratitude, God, or simply with the phrases “I'm stronger than a weak thought” or “How to get rich, I need to
        focus again” I know very well, that it takes effort to refuse negative thoughts, especially if you have been
        thinking so for a long time and are conditioned to think this way. Your head may start to hurt physically as a
        result, if you are fresh to this technique of simply discarding your thoughts. You have to do it every time if
        you want to have better results because your brain needs to get rewired again. But, instead of being angry that
        you lost focus and had to refocus, embrace it because you just did a mental pushup, this is progress, and every
        time it gets easier. This method isn't limited to thoughts exclusively because harmful cravings and bad habits
        can also be discarded this way. If you feel like eating sugar, simply ignore it and say to yourself “I am
        stronger than that.” </p>

    <p>This method is highly similar to meditation. Meditation is very simple. You start to focus on something,
        preferably your breath, and try to think about nothing else. You will notice your mind wandering again
        eventually, and then you simply refocus. Refocusing again is like doing mental pushups, you don't need to be
        angry for losing focus, because that's the very progress! It's that simple. Do this for 15 minutes every day for
        the rest of your life and your life quality will improve immensely. </p>

    <p>You are in control over your mind, your mind is the only thing in the world you have true control over. </p>

    <p>Now you may think that it's important to think about that specific thing that's bothering you. If it's important,
        resolve it! If it's impossible to resolve or just useless, your brain manipulating you with irrelevant nonsense
        outside your sphere of influence, use this approach. It's enough already, how much more do you want to suffer?
        Please don't mistake negativity for relevance. If it becomes burningly relevant in the future again, it will
        come back, but in a better form. But, remember, that redundant things don't happen usually. By thinking about it
        too often it becomes redundant. How does it happen that redundant things don't materialize; well, no one knows
        why that's the case. But, it's a good thing. </p>

    <p>Additionally, write your thoughts down right away. Your thoughts may seem too weird to write down. Do it anyway,
        they are going to haunt you until you execute both approaches, both refusing to think a thought and writing it
        down. Let it leave the metaphysical realm. Write down your thoughts as often as necessary and then discard them
        later. Use a paper notebook to do so, and remember to never restrict your thinking. If an annoying thought keeps
        returning and you see it 50 times in your notebook, the thought automatically uses its significance.</p>
        
    <p>It's in my experience mentally exhaustive to implement this with everything because some negative thoughts that
        appear irregularly once every 2 weeks can't be resolved this way. This approach is a brute force one,
        demonstrating the supremacy of the will above ordinary brain chemistry. </p>
