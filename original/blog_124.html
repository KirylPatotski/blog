    <h1>Redemption</h1>

    <p>I lived a life. Not in the sense of a goldfish would, but also in the sense of making many mistakes which I
        deeply regret. - From all of this I was able to find peace. What I will write about no longer raises my pulse or
        makes my breath go wild. I found peace. Finding peace is fairly straightforward. You don't need to read a text
        on how to redeem yourself. In your darkest yearning, you are aware of virtue's ways. Your conscience will thrash
        you until you process, confess, apologize, regret, and suffer. It will torture you until you get what you
        deserve. There is no way around it. </p>

    <p>I used to be bullied, yet later I became a bully myself. It was never physical or particularly serious, ‘only'
        degrading comments. Initially, I didn't participate in the bullying group in school, but then I took the lead.
        I'm not proud of that. It makes me think low of myself. The worst thing about it is that I got away with it. The
        only thing was a conversation in my class. I didn't learn anything. My ‘friends' turned away from me. After I
        got wind of that deserved betrayal, I wrote a few messages of hatred and resentment to one such ex-friend. I got
        punished for it, with the principal having a serious conversation and my phone getting taken away for a week.
        Everyone else turned away from me, which was not the real punishment either. The real penalty lasted a lot
        longer, the months that followed immediately afterward were made up of sweaty nights, obsessive intrusive
        thoughts, and deep regret. Until 2023 when my mind tortured me about it, luckily less strong. That's 4 years.
        The stains on my story will remain as reminders forever. </p>

    <p>The boy I bullied, I apologized to him and things are normal again, he is doing alright. The second boy, the one
        I insulted, I never saw him again, he moved away a few months later. I wish to see him, not to primarily
        apologize, but to thank him for the lessons. However, I know that this is never going to happen and I'm at peace
        regardless, he didn't get hurt by a text message, he didn't even read it, and he only got it because I made the
        mistake of setting the screenshot as my status on the messaging app. I could go on forever with the stupid
        things I did. I was stupid. In movies or so, women are attracted to the bully, but in real life, there is
        absolutely nothing to be proud of. </p>

    <p>Eventually, I found peace from that all, I learned my lessons and fixed myself as a person. Certainly, I could
        say that I had a traumatizing childhood and shallowed everything and then it came out, yet I doubt it's a valid
        excuse. Certainly, other people played a role and catalyzed my corrupt character and actions. Certainly, I was
        raised with some flaws. Yet, you know, it's easy to be immature. It's easy to blame others. I must blame myself,
        a past version of mine I never want to become. </p>

    <p>I was eventually able to find peace by writing about that nonsense, by improving my life, by letting time heal
        wounds, by jumping over 9th grade, and by genuinely changing as a person. By becoming warmer for example. It was
        deeply changing that brought the most peace, I have little in common with the person I was half a decade ago. In
        my darkest yearning, I was aware of virtue's ways.
    </p>

    <p>Do you know what else redeemed me? A few days ago, I wrote a letter to a former teacher of mine. I wrote of how
        dumb I used to be and how grateful I was for him to be one of the people to help me change. I brought up an
        example in the letter, which took place when I was 11 or so, in 2019 or 2018, i.e. at the same this story takes
        place. I didn't want to participate in a math Olympiad, yet he just handed me out the questions for me to solve.
        I was arrogant, lazy, and stupid to resist and not participate in that math Olympiad regardless. Years passed
        since. I long waited to write the email, and then I finally did. I wrote about how stupid I was. The response
        was positive and confirmed my development in the right direction. </p>

    <p>I learned a lot. You can find the lessons from this very mistake in every text I ever wrote or will.
        Responsibility. Getting to know your shadow and potential for evil. Choosing the right friends, not spending
        time with losers or fake friends. High standards. Resisting peer pressure. Moral virtue is more important than
        it seems. Life is a test. A life of growth allows for every negative to be compensated. That's also the reason
        why I propagate; learn the easy way, not in the hardest way possible. It also made me a lot more conscious and
        taught me the value of self-control. </p>

    <p>Only when you've been evil can you know you became good. - Know thyself.</p>

    <p>Now, perhaps you've never been bullied, perhaps you never bullied anyone and didn't commit any other moral crime
        or make a few stupid mistakes. Let this text be a warning. Being stupid will happen to anyone. If nothing
        happened so far, life perhaps didn't push hard enough. This is why you have to know yourself, if life didn't
        push you, it will - be prepared. This is not to ridicule my mistakes, I want to warn you. You will make stupid
        mistakes, and you will only find peace if you genuinely regret and suffer. Your mind will restore justice,
        especially if you don't get punished externally. I encourage you to set your mistakes straight to gain peace, to
        come to peace. In your darkest yearning, you are aware of virtue's ways. Redemption can come in the end. It's
        one of the best feelings to have. Yet, don't expect that you are going to stay free of scars, they are going to
        stay as a quiet reminder; do not be stupid again. </p>

    <p>God, teach me to love and to forgive.<br> Please forgive the sins I regret. <br> Amen.
    </p>
