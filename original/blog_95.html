    <p><strong><em>A story, one of pain, made worse by addiction</em></strong></p>

    <p>An awful period of my life. Magnified by the story I'm about to tell. It was 2018 and I was 11 years old. I
        shared a room with my 3-year-old brother and we lived at an old, cold fungus-covered moist Baroque house. My
        mother, sister, and brother moved away from an abusive stepfather and we had little. My mind at that point had
        some deep scars I had many unresolved <a href="blog_63.html">traumas</a> collected from the last 6 years. The
        life I was living was
        entirely purposeless. After coming home from school, I had nothing to do, nothing to work on. There was nothing
        I was particularly passionate about, I had drive nor will. I would live a shallow inauthentic life where I felt
        like an observer rather than a person. At that point, I had my phone for a bit more than 1 year. This was the
        first time I had been exposed to the internet with limitless stimuli, chaining me using YouTube and video games.
        Every weekend my mother went to sleep as well as my brother, I took out my blue Samsung Grand 2 and opened
        YouTube. Dark mode didn't exist in this era and I got to look at a bright white screen in the middle of the
        night. YouTube loaded interesting videos instantly and I would watch... The clock on my phone would turn from
        21:00 to 22:00 fast and I would think to myself, I just watched YouTube for one hour. Then, I would swipe down
        again and look at the top corner. Already 23:30. “Yesterday I went to bed at 0:00, so it's all right.”<br>I'm
        lost. I would hold my phone above my head and have my eyes closed, just listening to YouTube videos, until
        collapsing in tiredness at midnight. The next day, I would get up at 8:30 knowing how I wasted my life, time,
        health, and brain capacity. Throughout the day, this behavior wouldn't stop. I don't know how much I wasted on
        my phone; screen time was added years later to phones. My addiction started to control me. I wasted a stable 6
        hours per day. Wasted. I watched educational videos, yet learned little useful. Wasted. </p>


    <p>I don't know how long I have done that; I think I did this for a few months, especially during vacations and
        habitually on weekends. Eventually, I stopped, but it didn't get better, I simply started to waste time during
        the day instead of the night. I don't think wasting is the right word. Wasting is like throwing money out of the
        window, yet succumbing to digital addiction is worse. It does active harm and wastes potential. Since the age of
        5, I have been exposed to electronic devices, a tablet, which I played games on. My phone magnified everything,
        which I got at the age of 10. It magnified any problem I was facing, which I had an abundance of. Neither were
        midnight binge-watching sessions the furthest I have fallen…</p>

    <p>6 months had passed and it was spring of 2019. Every year from 2012 to 2019 had something in it that wasn't a
        slap from reality, but rather a kick in the stomach. It started with the tragic death of my 25-year-old uncle
        whom I had been close to, then losing my home country in 2013, getting bullied in 2014 in school, getting
        treated as less by my stepfather after getting a younger brother in 2015, the relationship getting abusive in
        2016, being homeless for a few weeks in the same year, then moving into the house where the original story
        started, and finally suffering mentally and not finding inner peace. Digital addiction made everything much
        worse. If you are weakened to such an extent, of course, you are going to submit to additions! 2019 was the
        turning point in my story. Instead of being the victim, I started to bully someone, by extend letting out every
        frustration accumulated from the past 7 years. Of course, it's the others that turned on me and that encouraged
        me… but in reality, It's my fault and my responsibility. I could have journaled about my traumas to resolve
        them, instead, I numbed myself with stimulation. I gave myself 4 years to get my life into order, that was on
        1.4.2019.</p>

    <p>I didn't notice until writing the text, it did take exactly 4 years and 1 day to fix my digital addiction: since
        2.4.2023 I haven't wasted time on my phone, social media, the internet, or video games. My screen time at that
        time was brought down to 12 minutes. The process of getting there took long, longer than it should have been.
        I've tried many things and kept slipping back, but only after figuring things out and realizing the problem in
        the first place, I broke free from digital addiction in 3 months, ending in April 2023. Now I'm experienced
        enough to condense everything into a bulletproof guide.</p>


    <p><strong><em>The disadvantages of phone, computer, and internet addiction</em></strong></p>

    <p>Most likely, (or should I say hopefully?) your story never turned as dark as mine. Perhaps you are thinking you
        are better than that, since you aren't 10 anymore and you may be right. However, there is no situation in life
        where you would profit from digital addiction. I'm saying digital addiction and it refers to video games, social
        media, the internet, messenger apps, and your phone itself. </p>

    <p>Try to think of a scenario, where it's better to have a digital addiction. I can only think of brutal life
        circumstances and trying to cope with them, digital addiction is better than alcoholism. There is no denying
        that it would be better to face the problems instead of trying to ignore them, that's why there is no
        circumstance under which addictions can be tolerated. Only as I broke free from digital addiction, my traumas
        got resolved. </p>

    <p>Before I teach how to break free, let's look at every disadvantage of digital addiction. This will give you more
        insights and leverage points and create the necessary pain for you to break free and understand how you got
        addicted in the first place. </p>

    <p><br><br></p>

    <h1><strong><u>1. The disadvantages of digital addiction </u></strong></h1>

    <p><strong>Social skills and attention span in a wheelchair</strong></p>


    <p><strong><em>Look me in the eyes.</em></strong> I went downstairs to my grandmother after having collected 76
        concepts for this text and started to write. I wrote a now-deleted paragraph about unnatural eye movements
        caused by internet consumption. Right away I saw how she was unable to look me in the eyes while talking and I
        asked whether she had been online, as it turns out she was. “It's instantly visible to everyone, because of your
        eye movements,” I said. </p>

    <p>I can explain what I mean in a very visual way: In a real-life conversation, you are looking someone in the eyes
        and holding secure eye contact. In contrast, while looking at a bikini picture on social media there are
        multiple
        focal points in the image, hence you are training yourself to make sudden eye movements. These sudden eye
        movements aren't rude, the other person simply subconsciously thinks you are worthless, because you look as if
        you are in danger instead of looking laid-back, projecting weakness. By having no eye contact, you are perceived
        as untrustworthy or unwise. Here is another example. While reading, you keep your eyes at one point at a time
        and move them slowly from one side to another and sometimes jump lines. That's the opposite of looking at as
        many bikini pictures as possible. </p>

    <p>This disadvantage can be removed, that's why it's the first and least scary. I wanted to write that it can be
        removed easily, but I doubt that, because it may take a lot of practice and time, especially if you have been
        doing it for years. Reading is the best way to remove this unattractive trait. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Talk at twice the speed. </em></strong> WhatsApp has a function, where voice notes can be played at
        twice the speed or 1.5x speed, based on the assumption that comprehension is faster than speaking. That's true
        for dead messages, void of meaning and complexity. If you are listening to some irrelevant nonsense, you will
        save some time in comparison to listening to it in person or at the original speed. Nevertheless, you must not
        listen to a message void of content in the first place. Comprehending meaningful messages takes time, sometimes
        years. By listening to some dead messages, you are wasting time, and it gets worse: if you train yourself to
        listen to messages at twice the speed, you will find real-life conversations too boring, and digital addiction
        will put your social abilities in a wheelchair.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Social skills you could have mastered. </em></strong>For a while, since December 2022 and especially
        since
        April 2023 I tried to get social skills, I had none since I never talked to anyone because of traumas, and
        time wasted and also because I worked on myself first. Digital addiction stopped the natural formation of
        social skills in my situation and most likely I'm not alone. Social media lets you forget real interactions.
        Hence, it is only a healthy relationship with technology, one without addiction, which gives your social
        skills ground to blossom. Only in that case are the benefits of instant connection cultivated. </p>

    <p></p>

    <p><strong><em>Ruined attention span and focus. </em></strong>Most people are illiterate and almost mentally
        disabled. Let's
        say you are trying to sit down to read something and read. You read a sentence, then the next, and you have
        already forgotten the beginning. You start to reread the same paragraph over and over. You simply can't
        remember what you have just read, because, after a few seconds, you already start to think about something
        else. Then, you realize your inability to focus and try to reread and it simply doesn't work for more than 2
        pages.
    </p>

    <p>If you ask anyone what they are lacking in life to become successful they may list some nonsense like time,
        money, connections, ideas, or knowledge. Those are all wrong, partially or entirely. What most people are
        lacking is the ability to focus. If you can't sit down and focus for 30 minutes straight, these transformations
        will provide the biggest benefits.</p>

    <p>There is a person who is reading this text and thinking: Now I've read 2000 words, let me take a break. That
        person opens now their phone, starts to take shallow breaths opens social media, knowing well, that this hurts,
        and spits on their whole bloodline with it. Please never be that person. How are you supposed to learn, work, or
        talk if you are unable to listen to more than 5 sentences at a time without losing interest? 6 hours of deep
        work with focus is what you can get to. Most likely you are having 0 hours of deep work per day, that's not the
        way it's supposed to be. </p>

    <p>Before this internet stuff, TV used to create edge-topic documentaries about ultra-specific subjects, for
        example: “Particle accelerators in the Soviet Union” and they lasted sometimes 90 minutes. These 90 minutes
        needed to be focused, and that was considered to be rest. Now, it's impossible to watch something for 90 minutes
        about an edge topic, because the attention span barely reaches 30 seconds. Then, there is for example Netflix
        with short shows, which last not more than 20 minutes and are designed to be addictive on their own. Most likely
        that isn't enough, I don't know a single person who isn't on their phone while watching TV. </p>

    <p>My grandmother pointed out that availability is a useful thing to have and I fight that idea. A 20-second
        distraction kills 15 minutes of productivity, there are many studies to back this claim up. That's because it's
        a massive distraction and prohibits the formation of flows and hence prohibits focused work. If there is nothing
        else you are going to implement, please at least turn off your notifications. If there is an emergency, the call
        will go through, if you are called more often than 3 times, if your phone is on Do not disturb. After all, what
        are you living for, if you are unable to focus on anything without getting distracted for once every 15 minutes?
    </p>

    <p>A short attention span will make every aspect of your life worse: relationships, work, health, and consumption
        behavior. It's the opposite of long-term thinking.</p>

    <p><strong>Messed-up sexuality</strong></p>

    <p><strong><em>Desexualization is the first step to success.</em></strong> The best productivity advice is to be
        hungry, as
        it allows for absolute focus and productivity for hours on end, and controlling your sexual drive is just as
        important. Social media is notoriously known for disturbing sexual activity because it leads to too much
        exposure. I thank God that I never got exposed to it, however, everyone I know, also from a Christian
        background had seen mature content. Because sexuality is deeply wired into the psyche, it is one of the, if
        not the greatest sources of motivation, and social media abuses this motivation to waste more time. It
        doesn't even have to be nudity or mature content, simple pictures with skin visible are more than enough,
        triggering and causing unnatural desires. However, already being exposed to mature content once, once, can
        create damage it will take years to recover from.
    </p>

    <p>Self-control is a key component of success and yet social media removes this trait and tries to discourage it.
        Some are trying to portray sexualization as freedom, misleading the youth. </p>

    <p>No, those are demonic and there is nothing good about them, you must categorically refuse them. There is no
        situation in life, where you would be better off with those things. I know that those things are “normal”, but
        it's also normal to have severe mental health problems in “modern” societies. Spreading adultery is the key
        accelerator to societal collapse, without exception. Discipline creates strength, succumbing to your sexual
        desires is weakness. </p>

    <p>Advertisements from the late 19th century were essays with one illustration of the product, now a picture of a
        pretty woman with skin visible. Social media and the internet provide too much sexual exposure, even if it isn't
        nudity. </p>

    <p>In the self-improvement space, there is a catchy phrase you need to remember: An 11-year-old boy can see more of
        the prettiest women on the internet in 10 minutes, exposed, than an emperor in his life. It's a shortcut, why
        put in the effort of a healthy relationship if there is a bikini picture of your dream woman on the internet?
        What should you work hard for, if you can get the woman of your dreams virtually?</p>

    <p><strong>Hostility by design, loss of emotional control</strong></p>

    <p><strong><em>The platforms abuse everything.</em></strong> Laws forced improvements in recent years, but a few
        years ago, it was impossible to delete accounts. You would need to contact a lawyer if you wanted to delete your
        account and all of its data, and success wasn't guaranteed, because the legal foundation was missing. You could
        still technically delete your account, but it would take forever, and finding the delete button was nearly
        impossible. </p>

    <p>Everything about social media is made to be addictive, abusing your mind. A factory in the Soviet Union may have
        had some quotes written in red on the wall, like “The will of the people is immortal”, the new central motto of
        work for these next-gen factory workers goes </p>

    <p><em>“How do we keep the sheep on the platform for as long as possible?” </em></p>

    <p>I know a bit more about this subject since I needed to use those principles myself, I tried to make my mental
        math apps addictive. Addiction is the central component of these apps, everything else is structured around it.
        You hook users by making it easy to join and to use, by spiking negative and positive emotions, adding high
        stimulation, and adding rewards (for example, likes, or content itself, or many games have virtual diamonds as a
        reward) and things to build on (for example, the subscribers, or streaks). </p>

    <p>Even if the intentions of the founders were initially morally aligned, social media costs a lot of money to run,
        it needs programmers, bandwidth, and storage. Money gets often negative attachments and it's the result of
        companies being forced into corrupt practices to keep themselves above the water. Hostility towards the user is
        necessary, otherwise, social media would need to cost money, around 10€ per year. There are non-hostile social
        media costing money, as a result hardly anyone uses them. Because they aren't hostile, they aren't addictive,
        that's why no one wastes time on them. You have to be addicted to these platforms to bring money because
        spending 2 hours daily on social media for 365 days only brings around 10€ for the platform, 730 hours wasted
        equals 10€ for the platform.</p>

    <p>Because of social media's massive user base, every micro-feature, layout, color, sound, and animation has been
        optimized to be as addictive as possible, because now there is a slogan on the wall: “How do we keep the users
        on the platform for as long as possible?” The people are doing split tests and thinking of new ways to addict
        users. Around 100,000 people are working with the exact goal of addicting you, with highly specialized knowledge
        and tools, with billions of funding. It's an impressive feat defeating 100,000 nerds working against you, be
        proud once you accomplish it.</p>

    <p>Social media is now addictive to a level, where it guarantees creating addictions. Smoking marijuana has a chance
        of around 15% - 25% to cause an almost deadly addiction, hence many people keep their fingers on it. Other
        substances, like heroin, can kill right away and are addictive instantly and guaranteed, impossible to resist
        with discipline as large as the sun, once taken. Social media doesn't addict right away and doesn't kill right
        away, therefore more people try. Most people know that social media is as bad as a hard drug, yet they don't
        understand what that means. Digital addiction creates withdrawal symptoms, intense cravings, and dependency, and
        shapes every decision unbeknown to your will, and addicts right away, or after a few times of using it. It's the
        same thing with every drug. Smoking marijuana for the first time creates a positive mood for days on end, so you
        end up taking it again, and again. And again. Then, you need it to function and to get positive feelings in the
        first place. The same thing happens with digital addiction. It feels great. When I first watched YouTube shorts
        in early 2022, I saw videos inspiring, insightful, and made with love and effort. That's positive reinforcement:
        I got conditioned that shorts equal high-quality pleasure and so I continued. I was also conditioned that
        messaging apps meant being social. I started to watch more and more. Soon, the fun ran out and I started doing
        it out of necessity habitually.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Physical health. </em></strong> Now, what happens to your physical health if you are addicted? You
        become weak. Unable to move properly, with a weak immune system, and a crumbling self-image. Most people don't
        do sports. I know that around 5% of people in Germany do. 5% is terrible by all accounts, in ancient Sparta,
        everyone did sports regularly.
    </p>

    <p>You may grossly underestimate the amount of people with unhealthy technology relations. The average person spends
        (trigger warning) 205 minutes a day online. Do you know what amount of time implies addiction? You aren't ready.
        I will discuss it in a few thousand words. I know that you are curious, addiction means, as a rule of thumb, you
        are spending significantly more than 15 minutes a day on your phone, and as a daily habit. </p>

    <p>Of course, you have no time for walks and the gym if you spend 3.5 hours on your phone every day. Those exact 3.5
        hours a day I'm using to go for walks, to the gym, and for meditation every day. Chances are, you are doing some
        of those things already, but that means, that time somewhere else is missing or that your addictions aren't as
        severe. Another aspect of phone usage is somewhat controversial, yet I believe it to be true, phones emit
        harmful and unnatural radiation.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Emotional and impulse control, rewiring your brain for the worse.</em></strong> Particularly the
        youth is suffering from symptoms of a lack of impulse control.
    </p>

    <p>I am a monster, full of aggression and a bundle of energy, but I have learned how to handle it and be a civilized
        man, and so have you, hence I'm calm. </p>

    <p>However, social media did something different, it simply stripped away discipline and willpower, especially by
        utilizing your sexuality. The brain develops wrong if exposed to the wrong stimuli, what do you need discipline
        for, if you can watch a video? Impulse control gets redundant. There is an impulse everyone has: grabbing their
        phone while trying to work. Do you know what my phone says? Unlocked once every 6 hours. Sustainable phone use
        is less than 20 minutes a day, this time is enough for instant messaging, for example, to look things up quickly
        or to buy a train ticket. </p>

    <p>Otherwise, your brain will continue to get rewired for the worse. It will see social media as the only source of
        pleasure instead of disciplined work. It will mistake likes, views, and followers for achievement. It's turning
        real life into a video game instead of chess.</p>

    <p>After a while social media, stops being fun and gets draining. Nevertheless, your brain is conditioned to get
        pleasure there, hence, nothing seems to make any fun. Naturally, you stop watching social media for an hour and
        lay in your dark room in bed, thinking about nothing, feeling nothing. Nothing provides pleasure anymore, you
        have no drive for anything, not even for social media. You start to question the meaning of life, religion, and
        family, some people turn to extremism as a result. It doesn't have to become temporary, sometimes it's
        permanent, but less severe and you start to believe that it's the way life was designed to be lived, rather than
        acknowledging what I just explained is called depression. I am telling you, if you break free from technology,
        you will go for a walk, and find a yellow bird in a bush and you will look at it and be happy. You will be happy
        with everything you do; it will feel like being in a wheelchair and then regaining the ability to walk. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Social media breeds losers.</em></strong> What do you think the bottom 20% of people do all day long?
        Do you think they are walking through the forest at night with an upright posture, iron discipline and while
        taking deep breaths? No, while on social media, you are sitting with a curved back, taking shallow and
        unconscious breaths, isolated, depressed, with anxiety, stressed, and with existential fear and doubt. Where do
        you think these things come from? They are symptoms and causes. While on social media, you don't exist, your
        body is in the universe and your mind is suppressed and numbed. I first started to breathe consciously in 2022
        and regularly in 2023.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Inauthenticity everywhere</strong></p>

    <p><strong><em>Narcissism, degeneracy, materialism, and promiscuity</em></strong> are often rewarded on social
        media and exposure to these topics is high. That's a huge problem because everyone takes an example from
        them, they see how those negative traits are rewarded. Why go to school for 20 years to become a doctor, if
        you can put shame on your bloodline for higher and faster results? Our future isn't going to look great, and
        that's why many people seek an escape, but this escape further accelerates downwards…

    <p>This is a very simple yet effective way to view history. Hard times exist and they create strength, then this
        strength creates good times, good times create weakness and weakness creates hard times. For decades, wealth
        kept rising, but with a delay, comfort, and weakness came to a rise as well, and digital addiction is nothing
        less than weakness. Luckily, anti-movements are emerging, as visible here, you are part of this awesome new
        community. Wrong values will create hard times and it's now visible to everyone that it had begun. There has to
        come a new generation of strong individuals for things to turn better, are you ready to be strong? They will
        promote the exact opposites: community, morality, spirituality, and family. Hard times will create a new
        foundation for prosperity for decades or even centuries to come.</p>

    <p>It goes beyond a societal level, there are likely to be inauthentic desires rooted deep inside of you, stemming
        from people without your best interest at heart, not even knowing you. Everyone posting on social media follows
        an objective, but most of them aren't in your interest. They are exploiting your time and attention for their
        gains. One of the most common inauthentic desires is traveling the world and “discovering yourself”. Do you want
        to be surrounded by hostile influences and values?</p>

    <p>It is the wise men who discover the truth and think for themselves, escaping the system and causing new ones to
        emerge, in line with strong morals. The wise man does not follow what everyone is doing or being told to do,
        instead, he thinks and acts accordingly, often at risk to his life. Socrates. Find your own truth and break free
        from the constraints of the masses. </p>

    <p><em>“Have the courage to use your understanding” and “Act only on that maxim by which you can at the same time
            will that it must become a universal law” - Immanuel Kant </em></p>

    <p><strong><em>Damaged personality.</em></strong> If you upload pictures of yourself, especially as a woman, you
        will grow into a much worse person, because you will get massive validation from losers. Even if that's just a
        picture where you simply smile without anything wrong with it posted on social media visible exclusively to
        “friends.” Getting validation for nothing, especially for sinful behavior, will corrupt character development.
        Here is the difference.
    </p>

    <p>Since 13, I had to fight against what everyone keeps telling me and it used to be a lot worse a couple of years
        ago when I started to change and no results were seen. I knew better and now I know that I was right. There is
        and was no validation for anything, it's rather the opposite, useless criticism, and I had to fight to develop
        as a person. Self-limiting beliefs were constantly nailed into me and I had to do it anyway. “Quit that
        programming course, it's too hard for you.” Now, I'm to the same nonsense, but already significantly less. “You
        are trying hard, you will get successful, just approach things a bit slower” There was nothing free and that's
        the way it's supposed to be. After a few years, no one will dare to keep telling me what to do, because only you
        know what's right, the validation received is often misleading, unless it's validation from someone who achieved
        your goals.</p>

    <p>When I was younger, around 5, my bright mind got noticed, yet I didn't do anything for it, compliments in that
        direction damaged me, and winning at everything I tried led me to not try anything and fall behind as a result,
        humbling me. If you grow arrogant, by receiving too much validation, it will lead to your collapse. You think
        highly of yourself, this will stop you from doing meaningful things and you will get humbled to a level no one
        wishes anyone. When this validation stops, you will have nothing. You can forgive young people's stupidity, but
        if you are stupid and no longer young, you have lost. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Detachment from reality and standards.</em></strong> “Faster, Better, Stronger” The exposure to
        always better, faster, and more will lead to a detachment from reality because reality is more boring than
        expected.
    </p>

    <p>This results in highly hypocritical behavior, for one, excitement for reality gets lost, as your baseline gets
        pushed to its extreme. Too high expectations will rob the fun of everything. My grandmother told me, that once I
        enter a relationship, I will get disappointed in some areas and I doubt that, because I have never seen a
        romantic movie, unrealistic expectations are missing and so are desires, as a result, no disappointment will be
        possible. Life isn't a 93-minute-long movie, it's much more boring than that, especially being exposed to the
        world's greatest at all times. Here is an excerpt from text #90.</p>

    <p><em>“The first lesson in Buddhism goes the following. You have a black plane and a white power, such as salt.
            With enough time and persistent effort, you can create a beautiful eye-pleasing pattern in the form of a
            circle and fractals. When you feel as if the work has been done, you throw your work and destroy pride in
            the process, freeing yourself. At the moment of greatest pride in your work, it gets destroyed and something
            new shall be crafted from it.”</em></p>

    <p><strong><em>They are not your friends</em></strong> The hypocritical behavior will enter here: you will have
        extreme standards and expectations for everything except for yourself. More than likely, you will spend time
        with people whom you know you shouldn't be spending time with, but you need their validation just as much as you
        need social media. Don't spend time with losers, have higher standards. As I'm telling you this, it seems as if
        I know you, because I can guarantee that there's a person you should have stopped talking to a long time ago. I
        know that it's hard, I have spent the last 2 years of my 3-year self-improvement journey alone too. Digital
        addiction creates this general detachment from reality, where things immediately obvious to others are invisible
        to yourself. If you don't break free from losers, the consequences will be putting weight on you for longer than
        they should.
    </p>

    <p>You must not disrespect losers, or hate them, however, if we should meet and I see that you are friends with
        losers (or even worse, with people I highly dislike), I will think less of you, because their traits will get
        projected onto you. Aren't you the average of the people you spend the most time with? There are 2 ways to move
        on from people you know are harmful, the first way is to simply stop talking to them, automatically they will
        lose interest, or the second method is more masculine: you tell them these exact words: “I think we have changed
        too much, and we should no longer be spending time together.” Better do it today, as a practical step, than in 1
        year, the second option is the better one, as it allows ties to be cut right, like this it won't haunt you. If
        you want to gain more respect from others, use the second method. If you want to make breaking free from digital
        addiction easier, it will help to get friends who have done that, lifting you, not saying “Now you are getting
        cringe, come back down”</p>

    <p><strong><em>Constructed reality. </em></strong>My life is depicted not to its fullest extent, still, I often
        admit careless mistakes or things I'm shaming myself for, yet at the end of the day, I'm living a “normal” life,
        I'm still getting up every day, I'm going to school, and was playing with toys until I was 13. The only
        differences we have are some radical transformations and time towards fixing life, and I'm giving you advice on
        how to replicate it. Chances are, you are at the beginning. That's why we can't be compared adequately, at the
        beginning of my journey, I didn't have a remarkable diary either. Contrast it with this: what if I went quiet
        for years, deleted every blog of mine, became ultra “successful” and uploaded only stories about my wins? It
        would be like the trailer of a movie rather than the actual movie. No comparison is possible, comparison would
        cause even more damage, because only a selection would be visible, therefore, not my actual life would be on
        display, but rather only what I'm trying to display. This is harmful, even if you know this effect and think
        about it at all times. You know that the picture of a luxury car often requires renting the car or having to put
        years into it. It causes damage to your mental health to be compared to someone severely ahead, especially if
        this picture gets distorted even more. Comparison is always harmful, competition drives performance. What
        happens to your self-perception, confidence, and self-worth, if you are exposed to people way ahead of you? When
        I look into real life, there is no one ahead of me in school, for example (hence I think highly of myself and
        try to fix that negative trait), but on YouTube, there are people who have been living right for not 7 months,
        but 5 years. If you are a loser and you are wasting a lot of time on social media, your self-perception will get
        destroyed, and rightfully so, you have a lot of progress to make.
    </p>


    <p><strong><em>Trends and fear of missing out. </em></strong>There is an allegory that goes the following. A pharaoh
        wanted his pyramids to be built and he needed tens of thousands of slaves for the construction. These slaves
        needed to carry stones and these slaves needed to be guarded by guards, otherwise, their escape would tempt
        them. The slaves had nothing to be motivated for and little to lose, therefore, they worked slowly and carried
        one stone each, the pyramids were built slowly, nonetheless, they still needed food and shelter. After careful
        thought, the pharaoh decided to abolish slavery. He started to call them craftsmen and started to pay them, but
        not much. Now, they have to pay for their food and shelter, hence working harder, convinced of their freedom.
        The guards have now become useless too, because the slaves want to be slaves. So, the guards start to work too,
        and everyone is carrying 2 stones, instead of one now with motivation. No man is less free than the one
        convinced of his own freedom. Freedom comes from thinking from having the courage to think for yourself.
    </p>

    <p>The economy is based on disposable products, every product has an expiry date, and most people indulge in it. I'm
        not talking about cheaply made Chinese products, some high-end products like phones also end up being consumed
        too often. The average phone lifespan in Germany is 18 months, which means, the average person already possessed
        at least 5 phones in the last 10 years. This consumerism is catalyzed by ads and social media by being pushed to
        its extreme. Consumerism is one of the worst appearances of the modern world, it is the cause of environmental
        destruction and a lack of freedom and meaning.</p>

    <p>In essence, today's world is more insane than it has been before, now food and shelter have become too expensive
        for most people, and the money they earn halves every 14 years in value and they can only buy low-quality
        products. Consumerism isn't limited to your freedom and wallet. I live in Europe, and I have been to Spain
        multiple times, in 2023 to Catalonia with Barcelona. Our hotel was one train hour north of Barcelona, and it was
        mountainous there. In a one-hour walk from our hotel in Pineda de Mar, you could reach mountains, a few hundred
        meters high. I went multiple times up there and one path had a nature reserve on its side. I looked closer and
        wondered what I'd seen; the entire valley was covered in black dirt-covered plastic bags. If that's not
        consumerism, I don't know what is. Consumerism is destroying this planet. My phone has a broken screen, and I'm
        going to use it for 5 more years. What are you working for, if the only thing you will get are disposable
        products, which you partly want only because of social media? Don't let me get started with fashion. Fashion
        starts with slaves working to get cotton, which is converted into low-quality fabric. This is used to follow
        some trends, which last no more than a year and then you are ready to buy new things again. My wardrobe is
        filled with things I have no use for because my mother filled their consumerist desires with them. I have 20
        sweaters only need 3. That all goes back to a shortened attention span: why buy something of high quality if you
        can buy something new every month instead? The internet is full of crap to be sold and some companies thrive on
        ultra-cheap product promotion by influencers. </p>

    <p>I can't believe a person who has deprived themselves of any input and just stared at their white ceiling for days
        would think to themselves: if I end this period, the thing I want to get out of life are cheaply made disposable
        products with a short lifespan, which take away my freedom and destroy nature. Consumerism and materialism are
        glorified on social media, but even if you know rationally about the harm of consumerism, you may do it anyway,
        because you get subconsciously conditioned to connect consumerism to happiness. That's what rewiring for the
        worse means.</p>

    <p>There is also another spiritual problem with consumerism, it destroys meaning and makes every item meaningless.
        That may sound weird, let me explain. There is a guarantee you have a toy you kept since childhood, which is
        valuable to you. I have a little brown Mercedes on my shelf, which belonged to my young uncle who died in a
        motorbike accident, of which I had a copy in blue. But what if it became replaced with a short attention span
        and would be broken and thrown away years ago, this piece of meaning would be missing and would need to be
        filled in another way. The reverse applies too, if there is an item reminding you of trauma, it's effective to
        get rid of it, and the meaning attached to this item will disappear. If there is no item to remind you of that
        trauma, it will be deeper inside of you instead. </p>


    <p><strong><em>The issues of free will.</em></strong> Free will is one of the foundations of Western philosophy,
        theology, and justice. Yet, addictions strip this free will, by adding a bias, causing inauthentic thoughts and
        desires, and that's not everything. Kids are known to be unbiased in their speech, many children told me that
        they wanted to go to middle school rather than to a Gymnasium because they would have more time to play video
        games. From an outside perspective, it makes no sense and it's obvious that the addiction was speaking. This is
        an extreme example, but there is a high chance you have said no to something because it was easier to be on your
        phone instead. Maybe you lie by saying you are an introvert to hide your social awkwardness caused by social
        media, maybe you see a life-changing opportunity and deny it because you were too addicted. Remember, an
        addiction appears after more than 15 minutes of daily consumption. By indulging in addiction, you start to build
        your life around it, because the bigger bricks get laid first. You aren't laying bricks, you are building a
        cathedral, this time with broken bricks. There is a high chance you have or had the thought, which suggests
        social media is needed in your life. Is this something you thought on your own, or did you think that because
        you assumed to think “practical”? Why do you think uploading a picture where you are smiling is only visible to
        “friends” does no harm? Why do you believe to need social media to relax or to be social? Why do you believe
        that what I'm asking and claiming is “extreme” or even “exaggerated”? Why is your mind filled with excuses right
        now, why?
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Authenticity.</em></strong> 6.7.2023 and I saw in public, that “Have the courage to think for
        yourself” is a
        phrase I need to use more often, as there is always a bias with whatever you hear and it's not always
        friendly. Everyone follows a goal. I want to manipulate you into what I believe to be the best for you,
        under the assumption that it will serve you well. But be careful with everything you consider to be true why
        you consider it to be true, and where it comes from. Does the person have your best interest at heart and
        does the person even know you? Where does any piece of knowledge lead to? You need to keep your eyes open
        and your head down, missteps are easy to make and easy to prevent. If you have nothing to lose, you may
        stick true to yourself. But, as already repeated in older blogs, if you aren't a billionaire, you have no
        power or influence. Most people are constrained deeply within their thinking and never question anything.
        They automatically censor their mind. Deprive yourself of anything and learn more, that's necessary to find
        out if it's something from the outside or purely based on your experiences. If you base your reality solely
        on your experiences, your worldview could drastically differ from your current one.
    </p>

    <p></p>

    <p><strong><em>Privacy.</em></strong> What information you give out and to whom is critical as well. You know fairly
        much about me, but that risk is worth it (as my existence relies on it). However, you don't know what anyone
        else is called, or how my family is structured, nor do you know my passport number, full name, or birthday,
        because that's no one's matter.
    </p>

    <p>What do you think, does social media and the companies know about you? It's the equivalent of talking for hours
        every day to the same person, but even more extreme, because you don't need to restrict yourself while on the
        internet. The same applies to the obvious, everyone is going to search your name before deciding to spend time
        or money with you or simply employ you. Let's say there is an image of you at a party, no one is going to think
        higher of you. My wife will know everything about me and I will know everything about her, hence picking the
        right wife is crucial, but then why are you sharing your data with some app without the same amount of
        hesitancy? Do you want to be exposed to personalized ads sparking inauthentic desires and getting stuck in your
        mind? Do you think some billionaire needs to use the internet, or do you think he is more likely to put his
        privacy above everything? I wouldn't even consider using an app, if it requires me to sign up, except if I think
        through it a couple of days if I want that. Successful and influential people are very categoric in this area:
        there are 3200 billionaires, and you will find it impossible to find pictures of them, except the picture of
        them in a suit, if they are extreme. There are people fully invisible to the radar, outside the system because
        they own it. Be a lot stricter with your data too! Even if there are no evil intentions by the company, what if
        the company gets hacked? Additionally, categorically deny pictures (or even worse, your voice) to be found
        online, unless it's a central part of your life, like in my case, where I do YouTube. If you want to prevent the
        abuse of your voice, implement a unique code word with every person you a speaking to. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Distractions and instant gratification.</em></strong> While I have already mentioned a distraction
        from problems by the system, as well as a killed attention span, it
        goes further. Stress shows that you have wasted time and need to hurry now. From experience, if you genuinely
        try your best at all times, you will never feel stressed, even if the pressure rises. Additionally, stress can
        be enjoyed by some people, for example, I like stress, it gives me great pleasure because being productive is
        better than wasting time. It may sound like I try to cope by enjoying stress, but I do like stress, because
        that's what I want, I don't want to waste time on social media. Sometimes it's 9:30 and I have already 6 hours
        of deep work behind me and I have nothing else to do. If you stop using social there is going to be so much time
        released, that you won't get into tight situations often. It's the same thing with categorically telling the
        truth, you will never get into a scenario where you are forced to lie. For years I didn't lie, if someone asked
        how their outfit looked, I told them that I found it ugly or pretty. If you never procrastinate again and never
        distract yourself from focused work, you will experience a high level of calmness. You will also learn, that
        there isn't that much to do, and you will have more time for your health for example. Social media kills focus
        and attention while overstimulating. Overstimulation makes blind, both literally and figuratively. Yesterday the
        driving instructor talked about one of the most common causes of death while driving, explaining the concept of
        “club accident.” Your eyes aren't rested and are exposed to high contrasts of differently colored bright sharp
        focused lights, it's hard to see physically afterward, especially at night. That's like looking into the sun,
        there is a green spot for a few minutes as a result, in this case, it simply applies to the entire vision. It
        makes it hard to comprehend anything, which means, overstimulation blinds. Constant overstimulation, that's what
        social media is, makes you blind to everything outside of social media. Imagine how many opportunities you have
        missed because of it. Being constantly overstimulated overloads the mind and weakens it, especially if you
        consume nonsense, propaganda, and sexualized content. It takes away rest and time to process things. Instead,
        you get shoved up in harmful input. You need writing and boredom to process things, you don't need to watch to
        process. Social media removes boredom, yet boredom is necessary for productivity and creativity. It would change
        your life trajectory forever, if you were 20% more creative, smart, healthy, and productive, because of
        compounding results. What are you sacrificing it for? For some mindless time, which damages every area of life?
        Social media prevents discipline and makes you live a shallow and inauthentic life, if you do nothing about it,
        this will be the rest of your life.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Docile little sheep. </em></strong>You might rightfully point out, that your train ticket is better
        to have digitally than on paper, after all, you are saving pollution by doing so. That's nonsense, printing a
        train ticket costs nothing and it weighs nothing. Alone holding your dirty phone, yes when did you clean it the
        last time(?), creates temptations to look at social media during the train ride rather than reading. Someone
        uses eBay on her phone to sell her stuff or to buy stuff second-hand, which is noble, but it shows a problem, to
        begin with: why did you buy so much in the first place? Is the time spent putting things on the internet to sell
        them time spent with high pleasure and progress towards your life's goals? What's the moral benefit of wasting
        time on the internet? It would be better to just donate those things, this would save both time and effort,
        money by extent, instead, you are sacrificing your time for what? It shows a much bigger problem. You lack
        freedom, location, time, as well as financial. If you can't decide what part of the internet to use, when, and
        where, you lack freedom.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Not enjoying the moment.</em></strong> When I sit somewhere to wait, I'm often the only one present
        and taking deep breaths, everyone else is sunk in their phone. Who do you think is happier?
    </p>


    <p><strong><em>Video games: Faking progress and freedom.</em></strong> Some video games contain sexualized,
        mind-numbing, and violent content, all the disadvantages of social media are combined as well. It's
        overstimulating, addictive, and so on. The only advantage of video games is that there is no harmful information
        inside of them, I don't know any video games spreading misinformation. </p>

    <p>Nevertheless, imagine a video game, that isn't too stimulating, not violent, and not sexualized, there are plenty
        of them too. I enjoyed a game, where you had our solar system and you are free to do anything you want. You have
        rocket parts with which you can build a rocket, space station, rover, or base on another planet and this game is
        fully free, without distracting ads, and made with love and attention to detail. Then there is one of the most
        popular video games of all time, it's called Minecraft. It's a minimalist sandbox game, meaning you are free to
        play the game in the way you like. You can build something, explore, or try to survive in an infinite world,
        this game is also great</p>

    <p>Both games have a fundamental flaw because of their nature as games. If you are free to do whatever you want in
        such a world, why should you fight for freedom in the real world? Why should you work hard and get rich, if you
        can build your dream house in a game? If you like space exploration, you shouldn't play a game around it, you
        should align your whole life with it instead. Just as with the second game. If you enjoy doing whatever you want
        and being free, free yourself in real life first. Only pursue what is real, there is no value in the
        inauthentic. Video games are never an escape from reality and they fake progress, giving a false sense of
        accomplishment. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Combined bad habits. </em></strong> When I got rid of all bad habits and completed my journey in
        April 2023, I got rid of the remaining bad habits simultaneously, because they are often combined. For example,
        eating junk is undoubtedly combined with being on your phone while eating and praying while eating healthily.
        While using social media, you are more likely to procrastinate, watch adult entertainment, and have little
        discipline. So, while using your phone, you are more likely to use social media, which leads to other bad
        habits. It's a temptation almost impossible to resist because it is easy to open Instagram. If you want to get
        rid of a bad habit, you will have to fix your life and make better habits easier while making bad habits harder.
        Bad habits are mostly a result of some previous thing, such as an emotion, time, or action, you have already
        trained yourself to connect those things with the bad habit. Waking up and taking your phone is one of the most
        common bad habits. Once you take your phone, why not check social media? If you check social media, why not stay
        a few minutes on it? There is another bad habit you are likely to have, which is caused by your phone love. The
        snooze button. It creates temptation too large to resist for me and I'm highly susceptible to it. That's why I'm
        using an alarm clock.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Missing rest and constant pressure</em></strong> Similar to the fear of missing out, being available
        at all times is highly unnatural. This ignites grabbing your phone in the first place and prevents any rest
        because, at all times, there could be someone calling or messaging you. Your crush may ask you out, you may get
        invited to a birthday party or they may inform you that school closes for months, which happened on 16.3.2020.
    </p>

    <p>This is another key contributor to stress, as there is no clear separation between work and rest. This is a key
        contributor to a 10-year expanded life expectancy of billionaires: they know that no one can interrupt them with
        some nonsense, because they are in control. Always being alert for new messages creates huge pressure.</p>

    <p>I have a few little bad habits, for example, I lay in bed to write these texts instead of sitting or standing. *
        I think that this contributes to poorer sleep habits altogether, it takes 40 minutes for me to fall asleep
        because I work where I'm supposed to sleep. This prohibits turning off properly. In comparison to fearing
        emails, messages, or calls, this detail fades into insignificance. I can let days pass before checking messages
        or emails and I know for sure that no one is going to call me because they know I'm out of reach and my life
        quality has never been higher. It's an amazing life if there is no one able to reach you except past your work
        time, and you spend your days working hard, calm, mindful, and with excellent health and focus, don't forget
        that this is your goal. You sleep a lot deeper, longer, and fall asleep faster. Hence, it is the healthy
        relation to technology that allows for progress to be made. </p>

    <p>Checking instant messages is something you are allowed to do after some deep work has been done.</p>

    <p>*Admittedly, I edited this text a few days later and I have broken free from this habit.</p>

    <h1><strong><u>2. Self-limiting beliefs you may have</u></strong></h1>

    <p><strong><em>I'm not addicted.</em></strong> Let's analyze it, most likely you are. Now you are ready to hear the
        explanation of why you are addicted and the magical 15-minute number. </p>

    <p>First of all, more than 4 hours a day is a severe addiction, and if you waste this amount of time on digital
        addiction a day, there is a long way to go, I started with 6 hours in 2018, so it's possible. As I started to
        break free from my phone, I noticed something. A screen time between 40 minutes and 2 hours is what “healthy”
        people have, and it shows that you are unable to live without your phone. If you are unable to live without your
        phone, isn't that an addiction? You may say something silly like “You can't live without food either”, yes, food
        is natural, but your phone isn't. Don't pretend to be provocatively stupid. This 40+ minute screen time shows
        that you are constantly thinking about your phone, which is a second red flag. If you were to lose your phone at
        a screen time of as little as 40 minutes a day, you would experience light withdrawal symptoms, such as
        increased bad habits, mood swings, stress, sleeplessness, back pain, and aches and you are likely to get sick.
        These things are typical withdrawal symptoms, this guide will combat every one of them, so don't worry. Next, a
        screen time between 15 and 40 minutes would still cause problems, as it means your phone is often your companion
        part of your routine. For example, you are still checking messages, regularly or irregularly, and would miss
        your phone if it got lost. </p>

    <p>For years I had a screentime of more than 4 hours a day, then since December 2020 around 2, finally, I moved in
        the range of 10 minutes per day in April 2023, after starting extreme, slipping back and cutting slowly since
        December 2022. Finally, in October 2023 I jumped into the 5-minute-a-day category and the changes are entirely
        different again: it disappears from your consciousness entirely. A screen time below 15 minutes makes your phone
        nonexistent, except if you use it with intent to call someone for example. Unless your screen time or wasted
        time is less than 15 minutes, you will need this guide. If you aren't addicted, why can't you spend days without
        your phone?</p>

    <p>A screen time of less than 15 minutes is enough to enjoy every benefit of your phone with its convenience and
        instant messaging. That's your goal. 15 minutes is enough time for every positive and to prevent any negative.
        From my experience of myself and of others, 15 minutes is enough, if more time is necessary, follow the steps I
        will discuss later after you have broken free from addiction. Remember the starting paragraph? <em>Hence, it is
            the wise student, who has the humility to find space for improvement and improves to eventually surpass his
            ancients.</em></p>


    <p><strong><em> It doesn't hurt me.</em></strong> This self-limiting belief has an easy counter: There is no amount
        of time wasted on digital addiction that would improve your life under any circumstances. Yes, the effects may
        be little, yet they aren't nonexistent. However, there's an ocean of hostility, meaning light damage spreads
        everywhere and is fairly large as a sum. </p>

    <p><strong><em>I'm consuming educational content.</em></strong> You would be better off reading. I watched
        educational videos all the time, and read how terrible my life was. I will explain more about watching YouTube
        later.</p>

    <p><strong><em>I need to stay informed.</em></strong> No, you need to focus. As long as you aren't a billionaire,
        your opinion doesn't matter anyway.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Moderation is possible.</em></strong> Never if it's a habit and you are addicted. When you stop being
        addicted, you will have no desire for video games or social media, which means, this is a truly self-limiting
        belief. </p>

    <p><strong><em>I need WhatsApp.</em></strong> The conversations on WhatsApp aren't meaningful, and you will lose
        nothing if you break free from them. If you want WhatsApp to do less mental harm, disable reading confirmations.
        Enjoy your friends in person instead. Instant messaging has its place and it's for single-sentence
        conversations. “Could you pick me up at 17:00 today” is already the limit to instant messaging. Instant
        messaging shouldn't replace real conversations, it wasn't designed this way. </p>

    <p>From 26.10.2023 - 9.11.2023, I didn't open my phone and WhatsApp; therefore, I'm used to little exposure to those
        things. But, when I opened WhatsApp today, I got reminded of the damage it does, instantly. The damage isn't
        large in comparison to social media, but it's still there if you value your mental health. That's because most
        messages are void of content, hence, I'm unable to process them, that means, they act directly as poison.</p>

    <p><strong><em>You aren't happier without digital addiction. </em></strong> To get rid of this belief, visit me in
        real life or analyze if you would be happier without all of the damage social media does.</p>

    <p><br><br></p>

    <h1><strong><u>3. Break free</u></strong></h1>

    <p><strong><em>Make it painful.</em></strong> We have almost finished this step, yet not completely. There is one
        thing I've done and it made me cry, even though I'm male and this is something of absolute necessity. This is
        something short and powerful, the turning point in (for me in December 2022) and you will remember it for the
        rest of your life. </p>

    <p>Take a piece of paper and take out your phone. Now, estimate at what age you got your phone. I got mine with 10.
        Then, write down how much time you wasted daily. I wasted from the ages from 10 to 13 4 hours a day, from 13 to
        16 2 hours per day, and from 16 0 hours per day. I want you to capture the numbers on paper. Then calculate your
        number: 3*4*356 + 3*3*365 + 1*0*365 = 7,557. I had wasted 75 hundred hours. There are 8,760 hours in a year.
        This time created damage; it wasn't just wasted. I thought of my life trajectory and how it could have been. It
        took 500 hours to learn how to program, driving school (will take) 70 hours, and 200 hours to write a
        100,000-word blog. That's nothing in comparison. 200 hours is nothing in comparison to 8,000. Visualize yourself
        on your deathbed, having wasted your life on digital addiction.</p>

    <p>If it's painful enough, you will never touch your phone again. If you cry too, your will and regret will get
        strong enough to break free from the chains of digital addiction. Just saying “you have wasted years of your
        life” isn't enough, it had to be made painful, by you learning it yourself. I would like to cite one of my
        earliest blogs (blog #12, “Monk mode, transform your life forever, hard”)</p>

    <p><em>“There are 2 single motivators, the desire to gain pleasure and the desire to minimize pain. Every motivation
            that comes into your mind can be categorized in one of them or even in both. […] Using this knowledge, the
            answer to the question of how to gain motivation becomes already obsolete. Let's say you need the motivation
            to start something life-changing, where would you place the moment of the decision, at an emotional high or
            an emotional low? Only if you are truly unhappy, you will be willing to change, to avoid pain. If you don't
            experience this level of pain, which is necessary for you to break free, let a few more years pass by. You
            will see how many opportunities you missed, how much of your health got removed, how much your future got
            worse because of short-term thinking, how much potential got destroyed for nothing, how many days passed
            without progress, how often you struggled for nothing and you will realize how many years of your life have
            been wasted, how many years of your youth have been wasted, and you will gain the ultimate portion of
            motivation through something called regret, a bitter form of pain because lasting exceptionally long. Once
            you experience this, it may already be too late to change your life, but at least you thought, that you had
            fun as you were younger. Unfortunately, it's not enough to decide rationally, that you want to improve your
            life, because you will slip back towards comfort easily. You have to make your current situation as painful
            as possible, to be able to make exceptional progress. Visualizations can help, otherwise, there is no
            shortcut.”</em></p>

    <p>You are going to regret wasting your energy, mental, physical and emotional health, youth, time and potential.
        Change now to minimize regret.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Everything aligned against you.</em></strong> In the beginning, everything is aligned against you,
        yet you have still no excuses, and pain lets you fight against this misalignment, your thought, and your
        environment, both social, psychological, physiological, and physical is misaligned against you. Long-held and
        intense habits are harder to break free from because they have started to change the wirings of your brain. Keep
        this in mind and now I'm going to teach a wide array of proven methods that will work, but not in the boring
        point-by-point kind of style, but rather exactly how I did it with explanations. Not every method is necessary
        for you, the order may differ, your task is to dig for gold. These methods are part of the monk mode protocol
        and have already been discussed in text #12. I know that switching texts is awkward, hence, I'm rephrasing a
        tailored version here.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Start extreme.</em></strong> Once your destiny has hit you hard enough, you will be willing to
        change. For one week, better for two weeks, you cut out any bad habit at once and also anything that makes “life
        worth living” That means, you cut out any sweets, sugar, tea, warm water, music, light, books, reading,
        WhatsApp, YouTube videos, and any form of pleasure, stimulation, or input in general and every other bad habit.
        This will be combined with absolute discipline and willpower. The most important thing to cut out are excuses
        and delays. Start today. Iron discipline and willpower are something missing, and this week, you aren't allowed
        to slip back under any circumstances. There are no alternatives, no easy way to avoid or to shortcut this
        process, nothing desirable is easy and reachable via a shortcut. No one admires someone with an easy,
        excuse-rich life, only the hard lives are looked up to. If you have too many excuses, remember that excuses are
        part of your belief system. Your belief system is based on past experiences and is used to predict, or manifest,
        the future. If you have always failed to become disciplined, of course, you believe that you can't do it. Do it
        regardless of your belief system, because only then you will be able to expand it. Discipline will help you to
        stay on track, and discipline does wonders when you are hurt and full of pain. I did that in December 2022 and
        by no means was it easy, but I was in pain because I know I lived inauthentically. I was putting my bloodline to
        shame, many of them starved and I was unable to stop watching YouTube shorts. I used to watch YouTube shorts
        after being unable to work because I worked so intensely, that I would be unable to read for example. That
        means, finding an “alternative” like reading doesn't work, it never will, because addictions are stronger than a
        fragile new habit. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Slip back.</em></strong> It sounds ironic, I know. At the beginning of anything, the motivation is
        the highest. I started showering cold in December 2022 and lasted longer than a month later, or even 2 months
        later, because my determination, willpower, and motivation decreased. Also in that time, I cut out any other bad
        habit at once, except sugar, because I stopped eating sugar in 2020 or 2019. I knew that I needed to regain
        momentum by resting and continued to watch YouTube and shower partially warm for around 2 months. Guess what? As
        I slipped back, the YouTube content seemed to be much more interesting, as already explained in the beginning,
        and warm showers seemed much nicer, that's why my happiness increased during that time, and it also increased in
        the 2 weeks of the total cut out, because I felt as if my actions had a significant impact. But having
        experienced both sides of the equation that burning feeling in my chest didn't go away, because I knew that I
        was able to do it, I got hope. Despite YouTube shorts feeling great again after this while, now, there was a
        constant pain in the back of your mind and it was called regret. Now I would watch YouTube shorts and be
        addicted to them but my mind would keep haunting me, creating pain. I knew that the enjoyment of discipline was
        greater than any bad habit. You may be tempted to think that it's possible to skip this process of slipping
        back, but it's not. You won't understand it right here, but let me report another facet: you have still no
        discipline and willpower. It will get drained and needs to be trained, just like running for example. You are
        unable to run a marathon, yet to start with running you will have to run for 3 km against everything holding you
        back to elevate the baseline. Then it will become easier to run actually. Willpower needs to be trained and you
        need to see what you are missing, the life you could have. For me, this phase lasted around 2 months. From the
        middle of December 2022 to the beginning of February 2023.</p>


    <p><strong><em>Cut out slowly.</em></strong> The next logical step is to cut out every bad habit one after another.
        You can start slowly, but if you start to count (e.g., a streak), you have already lost. If you start to track,
        for example, your screen time, you have not made enough progress, because you need to change systems and your
        identity. That means, instead of counting how many pieces of chocolate you have been eating and how many you
        “can still eat”, you simply eat less, regardless. I specifically don't want to overcomplicate things, since you
        need to make your own experiences and try out what works for you, but here are some specific tips that may help
        you. This phase lasted from mid-February 2023 until 2.4.2023. We will continue with the day in April and how I
        was able to quit it once and for all.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Change your identity.</em></strong> You aren't trying to lay bricks; you are building a cathedral. In
        the same way, you aren't trying to quit digital addiction, you are trying to live properly instead. Do you feel
        the difference? Laying bricks is something you have to keep in mind all the time, without a clear goal, while
        the cathedral makes it seem insignificant. Reread this sentence. Changing your identity removes the possibility
        of relapsing. I never tried to quit Instagram, because my identity didn't revolve around using Instagram. I
        changed my identity to an “ambitious young man living right and following a trajectory to greatness” instead of
        “someone trying to escape social media,” that's why it became impossible to view myself wasting time on social
        media. If you think of yourself as a loser with no willpower, that's what you will get. Changing your identity
        sounds vague, but that's because of its unexpected simplicity and potency. Does the man living on the trajectory
        to greatness press the snooze button, something I used to fight with until November 2023, after having quit my
        digital addiction for 7 months? Changing your identity is also very fast and it's free, you simply have to
        remind yourself constantly. Until June 2023* there was a banner in my room, “I want to make 10,000€ per month
        and I will do what's necessary” together with some other goals. It hung there for 1 year, and now I don't need
        it anymore, because I fully adopted my new identity. Identity shift is one of the greatest tools you have to use
        your subconscious bad habits are often a result of your subconscious, as they are automated. Shifting your
        identity allows your subconscious to be redirected, there is a high chance that this shift will remove every bad
        habit. Write a banner, change your phone background, and remind yourself of your new identity. You aren't trying
        to quit, you simply never do it. </p>

    <p>*After reading the correcting edit, I noticed how powerful this method is and I will formulate new maxims and
        goals.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Making it even more painful. </em></strong> There are a few cheap methods, which are surprisingly
        effective. A paper progress tracker will allow you to track your progress during the phase of cutting out. You
        must never lie to yourself and never restrict your thinking. It creates extra pain or extra pleasure if the
        entry in your progress tracker indicates authentic progress. Accountability is great and so is radial
        responsibility. In the original story, which started in 2018, I described how I felt passive all of the time,
        however, you need, to use Kant's words, to exit passivity. Stop being the person things happen to, be the person
        who attacks their destiny. This is a rich addition to your new identity. You can also tell others “I'm not a
        phone addict anymore” to add extra accountability. This will also help to determine if the people you are
        telling are genuine. The help of others is extremely powerful, ironically, a community to break free from
        digital addiction may be useful. Friends, if they are genuine, will help too. </p>

    <p><strong><em>While cutting, find lower alternatives.</em></strong> Instead of looking at gym girls,
        look at landscapes. Instead of watching shorts, watch longer videos or podcasts. If you have cravings for
        sweets, eat apples or dark chocolate. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Remove temptations.</em></strong> Removing temptations makes the bad habit harder because most of the
        time you don't crave your phone, but do it anyway because you have trained yourself to. There are a few things
        you can do here. I use this extension called “RYS (Remove YouTube Suggestions)” to make YouTube a lot less
        stimulating, I permanently removed comments and side suggestions, and shorts aren't displayed anymore. The
        YouTube website has a hostile side navigation bar because the second item from the top left constitutes shorts.
        This causes temptations impossible to resist and this extension removes this button. I would recommend
        downloading blockers of all kinds. You may point out, that in the long run, your willpower needs to be trained.
        That's true, but comes with a problem, which is the unnatural quality and quantity of temptations, it's too easy
        to slip back, therefore, it has to be blocked. Here is the thing. If you get rid of your addiction, the desire
        for those things is going to fade naturally, which means, you will no longer need your will. You can train your
        will with other things. For example, working, getting up early, cold showers, or resisting other bad habits. To
        remove temptations, don't just uninstall the apps, delete your accounts as well. Don't try to claim that you
        will need them for your business, otherwise, you would have been already using them on your computer. A few
        other things you must do include disabling all notifications and enabling permanent airplane mode,
        alternatively, turn your phone off completely and put it on your shelf, unless you specifically need it. Make it
        physically harder and time-intensive to use, by turning it off and putting it into a shelf. Make it as hard as
        possible to use.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Go to the gym.</em></strong> If you have been addicted to video games, you must go to the gym,
        because those things are similar. That's why video games are so popular in the first place. The gym gives an
        area to make progress in and can be treated as a game as well. You are free to do what you want and constant
        progress is possible.</p>


    <p><strong><em>Perspective and purpose.</em></strong> Now, or parallel, to the process of removing bad habits and
        distractions you may have noticed how much time got free. Set goals. Now, in case you don't know what goals to
        set, you need extreme monk mode for as long as necessary. You need to cut everything out and you need to stare
        at your ceiling until your life changes forever. Your purpose could be the absolute priority of your health, one
        where you sleep for 10 hours every day for example, and cook every meal with the highest effort. Set yourself
        around 20 different goals and write them on little pieces of paper. Now, throw away 18 of them. That's going to
        be the life for the next months. These 1-2 goals should be just-out-of-reach, to maximize results. Next to
        getting rid of all your bad habits, there are a few non-negotiables, that you need to prioritize:</p>

    <p><em>Sleep</em>: If you don't sleep well enough, you can't function properly. If you have nothing to do anymore,
        just take
        a nap. </p>

    <p><em>Sport</em>: If you don't go to the gym, because you have a rest day, at least go for a walk. Walks and sports
        provide
        stimulation, and therefore replace any social media and are good for your long-term health.</p>

    <p><em>Meditation</em>: Similar to sports, meditation lets your mind rest, it unlocks presence and spirituality.</p>

    <p><em>Constant learning and challenges</em>: Read for 30 minutes a day.</p>

    <p>Related to purpose, there is something I didn't know until recently: after my initial purpose was lost, I had
        much less to do and my discipline got less because it was the first time that something like this happened. But
        I also noticed that digital addiction didn't return, which is awesome. Some other bad habits returned, like
        sugar consumption, but that's all right because this retained my will and discipline to last even longer the
        next time.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Default activity.</em></strong> Before these changes occurred in your life, where you started to
        break free from bad habits and replaced them with good ones, you probably turned on your phone to distract
        yourself from boredom. During the cut-out phase, you slowly replaced it with other activities, but still, your
        conditioned actions to grab your phone have not gotten away. Replace this base activity with reading. Without
        reading I wouldn't be able to create such essays. Reading is valuable because it opens the door to further
        knowledge and eventually wisdom. There are a few differences between this text, the text written in June and the
        one written in April. Another default activity is boredom. Simply do nothing and give your mind the rest it
        deserves.</p>

    <p><strong><em>The task with the highest return.</em></strong> . Let's suppose your goals include becoming a
        YouTuber, what is the most significant task? Recording videos. Focus on these things instead of distracting
        yourself constantly and everything will work out. In practice, no more than 20% percent of your time will ever
        be allocated to a single most important task. The rest, 80% percent of the time, mostly consist of filler tasks,
        and always will. It's a myth that some work 16 hours a day because no one works more than 3 hours per day, even
        if your shift lasts 8 hours. With a bit of practice, your deep work time can reach up to 6 hours. The rest of
        the time, the other 13 hours contain as little as 20% of your total daily output, assuming a 16-hour work shift.
        If you work less, your productivity won't decrease much, but simply remember that working constantly has very
        little impact on the rest of your productivity. I learned this in the hardest possible way in 2023. Focus on
        work and work hard instead of working a lot! Focus dictates productivity and not time.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Fix damages created: traumas and regret.</em></strong> I have created guides on how to fix traumas
        and regret and they will be highly useful to you. Those things show some misalignment, and your life needs to be
        aligned. Independently, use the power of a ritual. During your cutting phase, set yourself a date when you
        officially break free. That's a technique for handling traumas, and it lets your subconscious figure out the
        rest.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Extra motivation, do it for her. </em></strong> I thought of extra ways to motivate myself, and
        thinking about other people is common sense in this scenario. That's why I put in the word “bloodline” a few
        times. Here is another thing I have done during the cutting phase in March 2023: I thought of the perfect woman
        I want. This was effective (and still is), and it had a consequence, my sister made me pay attention, as there
        was a girl who matched my type with precision, at least that's how it seemed, and that's another story. </p>

    <p>This confirms one of the earlier problems of digital addiction, which constitutes
        messed-up/misdirected/suppressed sexuality. My sister also constantly tells me that there are no “good” men
        known to her and I used to think the same about women, as I wasted my time on YouTube, which makes sense because
        social media puts the worst kind of women to the top. I think there are good partners everywhere, you just need
        to look properly. However, I relate to what she says, because social media makes people a lot worse than they
        should be: Here is another story that speaks for my sister's argument. I got up at 3:30 again and looked out of
        my window. I see around 100 windows out of my windows and it's Sunday. Guess how many lights were lit and then
        explain to me how I am supposed to become humbler. Say to yourself at all times “If I get weak, I will be unable
        to get my dream woman/life, hence I'm doing it for her” </p>

    <p><strong><em>Do it for him.</em></strong> I will go as far as to break up on the spot, digital addiction is a
        too-great red flag. It is destructive also because it causes inauthentic desires, after a few months without
        hostile exposure, I changed drastically myself. I don't want a partner who looks at their phone the second the
        conversation gets boring and neither do I want a partner with damages done from digital addiction and constant
        exposure to damaging content. It gets even worse if you not only waste time on social media but also upload
        pictures of yourself, those may be simple photos of you smiling and sharing privately with “friends.” Don't
        forget that social media use is also linked to loser friends, it's even worse if those are male friends, as
        already discussed previously. There is no point in being with someone undisciplined, with zero self-control, bad
        habits, and a ruined attention span. The only thing that can compensate for this is the will to improve, I've
        made many mistakes too, but I lifted myself and undergone massive character development. A missing will of
        improvement is displayed with the thought “Now you are exaggerating.” I don't use social media except YouTube to
        upload videos and to watch educational content. But, if your existence doesn't depend on it, remove social media
        out of your life. I wanted to write “Just because she wastes time on social media or uploads photos of herself,
        doesn't mean she is a worse person” but this would be hypocritical because I explained in great detail all the
        damage the internet can do, even under moderate or light use, because digital addiction harms every area of
        life. You would be a better person if you didn't use social media. Don't think that this behavior applies to me
        exclusively. Watch any of the successful YouTubers I do and listen to what they are saying. It's only the loser
        kind of guy who doesn't respect himself. Imagine not getting the right one because you lived in a childish
        illusion of acceptance. If my future wife is reading this, let this paragraph create the necessary pain to break
        free. Don't be arrogant, because you need to improve.</p>

    <p><strong><em>The compound effect, a changed trajectory.</em></strong> There are in essence, 2 life trajectories.
        There is the trajectory that 95% of
        people are following, which leads to health problems and no freedoms of location, time, and money and 4% of
        people are following a life where they have good health and time freedom when they are old and 1% of people are
        following a life where they have everything: money and youth. You have to decide and keep this in mind. It's not
        a single decision that will set you free, it will be this constant fight against yourself. Everything adds up
        and compounds, which means, that repetitions increase in potency over time. Eating 50g per day once a year has
        no consequences. Eating it for 1 year it will have little, and 10 years are going to show massive problems. 50g
        * 365 days * 10 years equals 182,500g sugar. So, whenever you want to eat sugar, keep in mind that it will kill
        you eventually. Whenever you are about to indulge in a bad habit, keep this in mind. There are 2 books I read,
        that helped me to break free, the first one is called “The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy” and “The Slight Edge
        by Jeff Olson” </p>

    <p>Another aspect of the compound effect is the following. In the beginning, there are no results visible, because
        you are laying bricks. When some results are already visible, that means you have already gained momentum and
        laid bricks for a long time. Therefore, it's essential to get rid of all bad habits. You already know what
        healthy habits you need: meditation, sports, clean food, good sleep… Then, when you start to see results, it
        means the trajectory upward is already guaranteed and will get faster by the day.</p>

    <p>If we are talking about the compound effect, let me remind you to sit upright and to take deep breaths.</p>

    <p><strong><em>You don't have discipline, neither do I.</em></strong> Going to the gym isn't discipline and neither
        is getting up at 3:30. To cite Sun Tzu, an ancient Chinese philosopher, from his chef-d'oeuvre “The Art of War”:
    </p>

    <p><em>“The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is
            to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom. […] To lift an
            autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the
            noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only
            wins but excels in winning with ease. Hence his victories bring him neither a reputation for wisdom nor
            credit for courage. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the
            certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.” </em></p>

    <p>So, here is what it means: discipline is doing the right things and this needs constant progress. Establishing
        good habits will bring success, but you deserve nothing for them because further progress requires constant
        improvement. Willpower and discipline need constant progress. You may think that you have come far by going to
        the gym, but you deserve no credit for it anymore, because if you aren't improving, you don't have discipline,
        and having no discipline is what gave you every problem and addiction in the first place. Willpower is similar,
        if you don't buy sweets, there is no willpower. If you lay your all-time favorite snack on your desk and refuse
        to eat it until the rest of the time, that's willpower. “I have trained my willpower, so I may just eat it” will
        put your bloodline to shame. Be your own best friend and advisor. Your best friend will reveal what's obvious
        from an outside perspective and what's right, being disciplined is one of those things. Discipline is doing the
        hard things especially if you don't feel like it and remembering what you are doing gives power to the will.
        Write on your wall, or set this as your wallpaper “At all times, I'm going to be disciplined and do whatever it
        takes.”</p>

    <p>It's impossible to imagine happiness when you are undisciplined, right? You are thinking nothing of yourself and
        your actions and beliefs reflect that. A strong mind doesn't allow weak thoughts. Discipline allows to break
        free from things that are wrong. Discipline creates happiness and freedom. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Do some pushups. </em></strong> If you know me in real life, I often do pushups, dips, and run a
        bit extra and this doesn't come from nowhere. Pushups are an amazing way out of bad habits, as they effectively
        kill bad cravings. If you feel like going on social media, do some pushups! “Well, but I can't do pushups” Hmm,
        that sounds like an excuse... “I'm a girl, that's why I can't do pushups” is total nonsense, there is a pretty
        blonde girl in the gym who does pushups as her whole workout. Excuses are weakness, discipline is strength.
        Challenge yourself to 10 pushups right now to increase blood flow and to get brighter insights than an ancient
        Chinse philosopher.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Mindfulness, spirituality, meditation, God.</em></strong> Bad habits are often a result of missing
        mindfulness, spirituality, meditation, and God. Atheism is another bad habit you need to get rid of unless you
        want constant mental health problems. Mindfulness is the skill of presence and presence creates happiness, and
        discipline and allows you to discard bad cravings, spirituality lets you break free from any desires and
        cravings and lets you view things without your ego, from another perspective. Meditation helps you to get there
        and faith in God is needed at all times. (Here is an excerpt of blog #91, “Full creativity guide”)</p>

    <p><em>“Meditation is very simple. You start to focus on something, preferably your breath, and try to think about
            nothing else. You will notice your mind wandering again eventually, and then you simply refocus. Refocusing
            again is like doing mental pushups, you don't need to be angry for losing focus, because that's progress! Do
            this for 15 minutes every day for the rest of your life and your life quality will improve immensely. Remove
            distractions for a higher speed and limit perspective to focus with full force.” </em></p>

    <p>Spirituality unlocks after meditating for a long time consistently and you need to have faith in God for things
        to work out your way. I was an atheist when I was addicted to social media, yet I moved on. I'm going to
        meditate right now for greater presence and insights; </p>

    <p>You notice a lack of mindfulness if you are not standing with your posture erect, breathing shallowly, and sunken
        in your thoughts. You start to crave intense emotions to restore your mind's default wish for mental presence,
        for example with conflicts or bad habits. Spirituality allows you to break free from this cycle. </p>

    <h1><strong><u>4. Moderation?</u></strong></h1>

    <p>After starting extreme, slipping back, slowly cutting, and then breaking free once and for all, let a few months
        pass before you touch any social media again, after these few months pass, continue learning here. It's
        important to not touch these things for a prolonged time for 2 reasons. You give yourself time to improve your
        life and to find a new schedule, make good habits stronger, and social media needs to be forgotten for you to
        form a new relationship with it, otherwise, you will mentally be trying forever to quit.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Moderation is nonsense.</em></strong> The concept of moderation is grossly misunderstood, there
        should be nothing mediocre in your life. For example, I work super hard for 6 hours a day and sleep sometimes
        for 12 hours per day, because there is nothing between intense rest and intense work if you are living properly.
        Free time is a lie, and so is work-life balance. There is either work or rest, nothing in the middle, passive
        time wasted on social media doesn't exist, it's inauthentic. If you can't work anymore, sleep. Yesterday, my day
        looked like this. From 3:50 - 8:00 writing parts of this text, then from 8:00 - 8:30 breakfast and cleaning my
        room, 9:00 - 10:00 speech therapist, 10:00 - 10:40 nothing, 10:40 - 12:30 studying of ancient texts (=slow
        reading), 12:30 - 13:00 watching YouTube, 13:00 - 13:30 lunch, 14:00 - 17:30 sleep, meditation and mindful time
        (with one interruption at 16:30, because multiple people woke me up), 17:30 - 18:30 continued writing, from
        18:50 - 19:10 dinner, and then from 19:10 - 20:20 hot bath, bed at 21:00 and I got up at 3:50 today. I was able
        to write close to 6000 words yesterday, 4000 the day before, and 1000 the day before that. Today I will write
        the rest of the text, I don't know how much, but not less than 4000 words. Moderation doesn't come from averages
        and consistency; it comes from extremes changing. Think further. Try to visualize your perfect life. Does it
        include wasted time under the disguise of moderation? </p>

    <p><em>Yin and Yang are in balance, a dominant Yin creates space for an equal Yang, yet moderation can't be found
            either,
            Yin and Yang are black and white, not grey. It is the change of focus that results in moderation.</em> </p>

    <p><strong><em>1 hour of video games a day is okay after breaking free from my addiction?</em></strong> No, it's
        not. While 1 hour a day sounds like moderation, it's a bad habit. Remember the phrase: “There is no situation in
        life where you would profit from digital addiction and wasted time.” If it becomes habitual, every negative
        returns. 1 hour of video games once every 2 months after an intense uninterrupted productive time is okay, as it
        won't waste much time and provide 10/10 fun. Imagine a future version of yourself, a highly successful
        competent, and respected version of yourself. Such people exist already and they may play video games in the
        arcade once a year. On the other hand, things like TikTok will addict you, even after you have broken free from
        them. They are just too hostile and need to be denied categorically.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Digital habits, drop them. </em></strong> I used to improve my mental math on my phone using my app
        and I studied Chinese on my phone for over 900 days. After careful thought and inner conflicts, I dropped both
        in October 2023. Here is an excerpt from another text, #87 “Purpose”</p>

    <p><em>“For you, it may seem obvious: drop it. But my brain argued against me. Be willing to change everything,
            that's what I have written. After a while of indecision, I made the jump in the cold water and uninstalled
            the app. 928 days. That's how far I have gotten. and after a few hundred Chinese words and countless spend
            hours, I feel bliss. I made the decision and I am happy about it. In a few days, I'm going to feel
            indifferent about it and maybe I'm going to sit down and watch the sunset and have tears in my eyes of
            gratitude. There is another thing that trapped me in the same way: it's my mental math app, and I let go of
            it too. I don't know what kind of coincidence it is, that on my birthday, I reached a 200-day streak. Now
            may I move on with a 355-day streak? Never did I regret letting go.”</em></p>


    <p>It doesn't make sense to try to learn a language or to improve your mental math on your phone, as those yield
        little results and take a lot of time. If I needed to learn Chinese, I would go to China for a few months
        instead, this is more effective than using your phone. That's because comprehension using digital mediums is
        frequently too low to be useful. If there is something you are trying to learn using your phone, thinking it's
        going to compound, it won't, it will only compound if it's your focus. Alternatively, use your computer. But be
        careful. You could be in an illusion of progress because digitally gotten knowledge disappears quickly. </p>

    <p><em>It is the student who learns by constant repetition in practice who makes progress. The student who pnly
            listens
            sacrifices progress, the student trying in practice will show greater humility and advance further as a
            result. Constant sacrifice is necessary to reduce weight.</em></p>

    <p><strong><em>Use your computer for everything.</em></strong> The design of computers makes it significantly
        harder to get addicted, especially if you installed blockers. Also, your computer is mentally wired to work in
        contrast to your phone. If you need Instagram for your business, use the website and just upload your content
        and read the messages, after you have stopped your addiction, it's possible to do that. YouTube can be
        customized to your wish as well; you can install blockers so that you won't see anything and can upload videos
        without destroying your mental health. After months of digital celibacy, you are allowed to watch YouTube again,
        only under a few drastic conditions. The extensions need to block comments, view counts, thumbnails, ads,
        sidebar recommendations, and shorts. Some blockers are even able to block entertainment videos, which is even
        better. That means you will be able to use YouTube the way it's supposed to be: with minimal distractions and
        purposeful videos. Watching long and uncut YouTube videos is equally as helpful as reading and the change will
        result in greater creativity. Be a lifelong student. </p>

    <p>I believe that social media and the internet are a shortcut to success and should be utilized. However, that
        doesn't mean that you should waste time on them by scrolling.</p>

    <p>Now, what if there are other services you need to use for your business for example? Well, in this case, sharing
        your data is a necessity, but you don't have to share yours, use a corporation and a separate bank account and
        email. It takes not more than 150€ to register a business email, accounts, and a corporation. However, most
        likely you won't need any of those things for the first months. I would recommend writing down exactly what
        company has your data and making risk assessments before signing up anywhere. However, this will fade into
        insignificance once you get to a certain level of success. Then you won't need to touch the internet ever again
        and fear your privacy, because your employees will handle it.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, if you are an individual, you can dispose of most internet stuff forever. Searching the
        internet? Chances are it's unimportant. Watching the news, sorry for having to tell you, but as long as you
        aren't a billionaire you have no say in anything, your opinion doesn't matter, protect your mental health
        instead. If there is something relevant like a new law, others will tell you about it. For example, there was a
        law forbidding gas-water boilers in houses. I have heard of it from others and protected my mental health,
        relevant things get spoken about naturally. You will never need social media for your business for example and
        neither will you need some specialized services like digital contracts. You aren't forced to use any shopping
        apps, to buy junk and you also aren't forced to use the public transit app. Use your computer for those things,
        and those are optional. They may or may not improve your life. Only use what saves a lot of time and adds value
        to your life, for example, Google or email. Remember that less is more and you need freedom. If you are in this
        monk-mode phase of absolute focus, forget about the news, focus instead.</p>

    <p><br><br></p>

    <h1><strong><u>5. Thinking further</u></strong></h1>

    <p><strong><em>Children and younger siblings.</em></strong> I know about the positives and negatives of social
        media, while social media connects people, this benefit comes with negatives attached that you could fill
        libraries with and even remove that benefit of connection in large parts. Particularly for children digital
        addiction is harmful and they are more susceptible. Give your children only a phone after the age of 14 and now
        you would rightfully point out that they need email and Google too. That's right. Now you may think that
        unrestricted internet access is harmful and you need to monitor them. I would say, you need to trust your
        children, simply inform them, that adult content will destroy them forever and that digital addiction will lead
        to a life of regret. Tell them about your mistakes, and how It's easier to never get started with bad habits
        than it is to break free from them. I will try to bring my house in order before I will try to fix the world, 3
        of my 3 siblings are severely or somewhat addicted. Fixing others starts by spreading the message. Share this
        text and add the message: “There is no situation in life where you are better off wasting time on your phone”
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Older people.</em></strong> Older people, until the age of 80 aren't less addicted, yet often
        forgotten. Often, reckless children or the older people themselves get onto social media and get trapped on it
        forever. Especially above the age of 70, they are unable to break free, because they are mentally like children
        again, but with a tendency downhill. This will make them not only almost mentally disabled like it does with
        kids, but it will accelerate the decay of the brain on a deadly scale. They will then die of dementia or other
        slow diseases of the mind and physical problems will get magnified as well. If you then try to take it away from
        them, they will forget about it soon, and also about everything else, their dementia will lead to guaranteed
        death, and the brain will stop working. People between 20 and 60 are addicted too, with the same consequences.
        Remember, addiction is anything above 15 minutes a day. And yet, older people grow arrogant, and this leads to
        their ends.</p>

    <p><strong><em>VR and AR, this hostile crap.</em></strong> AR is short for augmented reality and VR is short for
        virtual reality, they are essential an addition or replacement of reality you put over your face. I fear this
        technology to the extent, that one of my first texts was dedicated to it. They put every problem I talked about
        to its limit. If TikTok is on a little screen you can look away from is impossible to resist for disciplined
        people, these technologies will not have the possibility to be looked away from, you will be forever trapped and
        live a meaningless life. </p>

    <p><br><br></p>

    <h1><strong><u>6. Achieving greatness</u></strong></h1>

    <p>Some great individuals lived in ancient times and they all relied on a few key principles. For example, Socrates,
        Aristotle, or Alexander the Great. They assessed everything, every belief and opinion, and decided if it served
        them or hurt them, where it came from, and where it would lead. They decided what truth meant for them and found
        their truth as a result, with the support of great mentors. They learned things to set themselves free while
        having immense discipline and self-control. That's how you keep making further progress. </p>

    <p>This text is part of the knowledge to set you free, from digital addiction. Now, the other steps are necessary,
        especially the ones with immense discipline and self-control. Freedom is your biggest goal, digital addiction
        trapped you and now you will escape. You must find out the truth for yourself, hence I asked you questions in
        every paragraph. Happiness doesn't come from digital addiction but from the fulfillment of living right, a life
        of delayed gratification. Never will there be a situation where digital addiction will serve you. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Post scriptum.</em></strong> I know that this is going off-script, but I need to say a few more
        things. For one, there are exactly 90 days from 1.12.2023 to 29.2.2024 and you have a bit of time to prepare.
        Maybe try digital celibacy to get your screen time to 15 minutes in that time? There are 2 options, regardless
        of whether you're on time. Either you ignore it and continue suffering, or alternatively, you create lasting
        change. In February I will create a YouTube video about it, using this text. Before this, I will use the
        described 3 months to implement the other videos, around 50. Secondly, I put in around 25 hours and condensed a
        few years of experience and knowledge into a comprehensive guide. It's in your interest to share this guide to
        spread the message and methods. The third thing is a reminder. Sit upright and breathe fully.</p>

    <p>Perhaps, there were multiple points where your pulse skyrocketed and you were almost too scared to continue
        reading. Let this text clean your soul (catharsis) and set everything right again. </p>

    <p>This guide will be a waste of time if you do nothing about it. There are many points where you could have quit
        reading, yet you haven't. Start today with the transformations, before it's too late. After you turn on the cold
        shower you realize that your mind created greater fears than the actual water. Now, there could be a final
        self-limiting belief remaining. You may read this text and think. “Well, social media is harmful and so on, but
        I don't really want to change” Then, I want to say 2 things: enjoy delayed suffering or try to think from the
        perspective of the future version of you which made some or many positive transformations. It takes 50 seconds
        to delete social media accounts and 30 seconds to break free from people holding you back. The future version of
        you won't regret it.</p>
    <p><br><br></p>

    <h1>Comprehensive summary</h1>

    <p>Break free from digital addiction</p>

    <p>There's never a situation in life where you are better off with digital addiction.<br>
        Ask yourself the question once a week for the rest of your life; What's the biggest thing holding me back, that
        I could fix? If you ask this question with humility, it's likely to be your digital addiction. Hence, it is the
        wise student, who has the humility to find space for improvement and improves to eventually surpass his ancient.
    </p>

    <p>I want to save years of your life The goal of this text is to save years of your life, but I have to warn you:
        this guide is going to release the pain building up from the last years of your life.
        <br>2018: I would hold my phone above my head and have my eyes closed, just listening to YouTube videos, until
        collapsing in tiredness at midnight. The next day, I would get up at 8:30 knowing how I wasted my life, time,
        health, and brain capacity.

        <p>2. Self-limiting beliefs you may have</p>

        <p>- I’m not addicted<br>
            - It doesn’t hurt me<br>
            - I’m consuming educational content<br>
            - Moderation is possible<br>
            - I need to stay informed<br>
        </p>

        <p>3. Break free</p>

        <p>- Make it painful by estimating how many hours you wasted, to give some reference, writing 100,000 words took
            me 115 hours, there are 8760 hours in a year<br>
            - Acknowledge that everything is aligned against you<br>
            - Start extreme by cutting everything out for 10 days<br>
            - Slip back and suffer<br>
            - Cut out slowly over the span of months and set deadlines<br>
            - Change your identity, You are not quitting digital addiction, you are trying to live right.<br>
            - Make it more painful by setting goals or speaking to others<br>
            - While cutting, find lower alternatives<br>
            - Remove temptations, make your phone hard to reach.<br>
            - Got to the gym<br>
            - Remember what you are doing it for perspective and purpose<br>
            o Prioritize work or health<br>
            o Non-negotiable tasks are Sleep, Meditation, Reading and sport<br>
            - Default activity: reading, not grabbing phone<br>
            - Prioritize hard work<br>
            - Fix traumas and regret<br>
            - If you need extra motivation, do it for your perfect wife instead of yourself<br>
            - Remember the effect of compound interest, everything adds up<br>
            - Discipline and willpower aren't about good habits, they are about doing what's right against your will<br>
            - Suppress bad cravings with pushups<br>
            - You need more mental presence<br>
            - Unlock the power of meditation, spirituality, God, and presence<br>
        </p>

        <p>4. Moderation?</p>

        <p>
            - Moderation is the change of 2 extremes, not some average<br>
            - 1 hour per day is an addiction<br>
            - Digital habits, like learning languages, drop them<br>
            - Use your computer for everything<br>
            - Use website blockers<br>
            - 15 minutes of screen time is your goal<br>
        </p>

        <p>5. Thinking further</p>

        <p> - Children and younger siblings<br>
            - Old people<br>
            - Future technologies will be a lot worse<br>
        </p>

        <p>6. Greatness</p>
        <p>
            - Thinking for yourself<br>
            - Making constant improvements with humility<br>
        </p>
