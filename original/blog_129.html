    <p><em>This text is a collection of daily notes from the first week of April. You can see how great despair is to
            motivate.</em></p>

    <h1>Update from March 31st</h1>

    <p>I have news, I don't know if those are good or bad ones. My writing is going to be a lot rarer in the future. The
        girl who rejected me deeply inspired me to write, as it unraveled many lessons and mental conflicts. Now she's
        gone. Secondly, the recent texts have a message along the lines of: “Listen to improve or it's your fault, I'm
        not responsible for convincing you how to live right.” Next to my missing willingness to waste my time on people
        who don't want to be great to begin with and the missing inspiration from my rejection, there is another aspect
        that hinders further texts. I wrote a lot already, on every topic there's a text. How to be a man, how to do
        sports, the meaning of life … All written. I don't want to repeat myself too often. My life will have little
        change in the next couple of months, especially considering that school is over and university only starts in
        October, hence, there won't be many deeper lessons, and likely none that I haven't written about. When I live
        alone doing things, recording videos, reading, and doing sports, there is no need to write anything, I have
        written enough on that already. When my soul does not hurt, I cannot find deep relief through writing. </p>

    <p>What I'm going to announce, is that for the next 60 days, until June 1st, I challenge myself to create 30 videos
        and enter a focused period again. </p>

    <p>Despair is what will keep me going and pushing. I will further motivate myself by writing down my problems every
        day, even if they are very banal, for example, one problem from the last days was that I trained too much and
        ate too little. If you write down trivial problems, you get to fix them rather quickly. Another thing to keep me
        going is the strong urgency, life is short, and so on. There will also be other things pushing me, for example,
        the responsibility I feel to become rich and not let anyone around me down. But this is not despair, the main
        source of my new motivation. </p>

    <p>The isolation I'm in, as school is over, is despair but not the biggest source of purpose either. I can reveal
        what specific mental image is going to make me push the hardest. The girl who rejected me, if she matures fast
        enough and stops having male crackhead friends, will probably take someone who will be 26, not 16. This guy will
        have a car and a degree in medicine. He will still be a loser by all means (except the car and the degree), but
        practically everyone will see him as successful. He will be too weak to shower cold or to resist the slightest
        temptations. He will have no purpose in his life, and instead, he will watch movies with her while cuddling and
        eating chocolate strawberries. At least, he won't be as extreme as me, she will think to herself, deeply
        convinced of her righteousness. He would never dare to command her anything and she would be the boss, which is
        <em>of course</em> known to make women happy, all women dream of a useless, weak, and incompetent man by their
        side. Everyone already knows women get wet fantasizing about losers, this is certainly a universal law of the
        universe. </p>

    <p>This specific mental image is awesome since I know that I will be much further in life when a decade passes. It
        generates just enough pressure. Can I surpass a random loser in a decade to have more in life than just a car
        and a degree in medicine? Yes. </p>

    <p>Picture this. My parents will gift me a car too, chances are it's going to be more expensive as well, so half of
        the surpassing is done. The second part remains which is the million in assets, but I have ten years and have
        been working towards that goal for a while. I have not a single thought of doubt I will surpass that person.
        That means the deeper motivation is the desire to make her regret her decision. That's technically despair,
        every time I visualize the scenario of her taking this kind of guy, I'm helpless and every man knows how great
        that pain is. – Perfect motivation. I can make sure to surpass every guy like him and make her regret her
        decision using that pain, and spend my entire waking hours dedicated to that goal. </p>

    <p>If the source of energy for getting her ran dry, which I used to have for a while, I just need to use another
        one, the one of despair. You see, energy can't be created or destroyed. You decide how to use it. You decide
        whether you want to be depressed in despair or if you choose to accelerate with that energy instead.</p>

    <p>When I should see her at a party, that's perfect motivation. I would be unable to sleep, so I might as well work
        all night long. Even more so if she's with a loser. In the rare scenario that he is far ahead of me in every
        realm of human endeavor, that's limitless motivation. I know that what I write isn't lovely, healthy or
        compassionate, yet I do know that all other roads lead to pointless despair, that is, depression. </p>

    <p>If she loves me now and hasn't lost her virginity, didn't consider taking anyone else after I asked her out,
        stops doing things that listing would be pointless as I did that enough in practically every text I wrote so
        far, and comes to me, admitting that she made a mistake, I will have my old source of motivation back! I always
        position myself in a situation where I can't lose. </p>

    <p>So, what is the biggest thing holding me back? There is none. I need to gain momentum and regain my dangerous
        productivity, then I can let time tick. I'm about to live an amazing life.</p>

    <p>Occasionally, I will upload a few texts, daily updates, progress on my goals, or pictures from my adventures. See
        you!</p>

    <h1>Monday, April 1st 2024</h1>

    <p><em>Morning.</em> 4 months into 2024 and what have I achieved? Nothing. Life is short - especially if you waste
        it 'because you were in a weak phase'. </p>

    <p><em>Evening.</em> A bit more than two months ago I wrote a love letter, in which I wrote something along the
        lines of 'I like to run and I know you like to run as well'. For context, I only ran 3 km per day in the gym to
        get warm and didn't even go to the gym daily. Four times or so, in February and March, I ran 10 km, so I didn't
        run much. On March 24th I decided to run at least 10 km every day until April 27th. On this day in April,
        there's an 8 km race, going through the mountains. I took a rest day on Wednesday and have been running every
        day since without rest. I live 200 m from a Church, and it shows the time. Today, I ran to the church and it
        showed 14:17 (actually it was 15:17). I came back, and it showed 14:56. That's 40 minutes for 10 km. If things
        took a different turn, and she didn't reject me, I doubt we could be running together. 40 minutes for 10 km is
        an incredible time, especially considering I've been training only for a week, with one rest day, I didn't even
        run out of breath, or blush while running. I was in such disbelief myself that I used the internet to measure my
        route - indeed, 9.9 km. If I told you, that didn't sweat, you would be in even greater disbelief. So, on top of
        training for a short time, I showed no signs of exhaustion. That's what you get when you stop being soft on
        yourself.</p>

    <h1>Tuesday, April 2nd 2024</h1>

    <p><em>Morning.</em> Today, I edited tow á 20-minute videos and I think, I'm progressing well at what I do. What I
        need to implement is text #56, since I know that I'm not getting many things done and they take unnecessarily
        much time.</p>

    <p><em>Late afternoon.</em> Today I had to accept defeat. After I ran for 2.5 km, a strong rain and wind slowed me
        down to just 6 km/h. Additionally, my feet hurt a lot for obvious reasons: Running with the last rest day being
        Wednesday. I will have to take my second rest day tomorrow; I need to sacrifice my ego for a day, even if girls
        won't find that hot. While still on the run, I decided not to return until I reached a wooden bridge, which I
        did, thereby marking the 3 km line. On my way home, I had to accept another defeat, I was in too much pain to
        run, hence, I walked. So, 3 km ran slowly and 3 km walked, that's equal to 45 minutes. You see, God is
        beautiful, on my way back, there was a bright rainbow. In the end, it was pretty and I regret nothing. Very
        cathartic to get tested, humbled, and then redeemed. I was shown where I belong and that I truly am just at the
        beginning. </p>

    <p><em>Evening.</em> I like how my mind is on my side. Since I can't go to the gym, running or walking, why not
        record ten videos tomorrow? I can lock myself in my room until I'm done. I love you.</p>

    <h1>Wednesday, April 3rd 2024</h1>

    <p>A week ago, or so I wrote that I dream of problems to wake up in pain, and not of hot girls. Ever since I wrote
        that, I started to dream of hot girls. That's not very relevant for you, but the lesson is, don't underestimate
        that your speech materializes patterns in the mind. Anyway, 10 videos done. I had no way to fail, as I locked
        myself up until I was done. This was one of the longest days in a while. I was fully conscious and it was
        mentally very draining. If I felt like a loser, I would no longer. I feel like I'm 15 again. I also went for a
        walk despite a rest day. Tomorrow I will not go for a walk or a run, I will go to the gym and then bike to where
        the original route goes and walk it, which should take two hours. By around 18:00, I should be at the mountain's
        top. </p>

    <h1>Thursday, April 4th 2024</h1>

    <p><em>Morning.</em> Towards the end of February, I wrote that the realization of never seeing my friends and
        classmates again hurt. Now I'm thinking, I don't like them, I don't know what I thought I would miss.</p>

    <p><em>Evening.</em> How to turn a walk into a parabola. Yesterday I promised to go to the gym at 15:00, then to
        bike to the original route and walk it. I did that and arrived at around 17:00. As I arrived, I noticed that I
        was too stupid to bring a lock, so I took my bike with me. I concluded, that only a weak person would break
        their promise and return. As I biked past the train station, into the forested section, I did not encounter a
        single soul which made me wonder what people are doing with their lives when it's 15°C and everything is turning
        green and blossoming! Then, there was a section where I needed to fight uphill - until I noticed that I was too
        stupid to look at the map and hence struggled uphill for nothing. I took out my phone to return to the right
        path since I was too stupid for the map. As I put both objects back into my pocket, I looked down at the path I
        should have walked instead and saw a blonde girl, and a light blue t-shirt, strongly reminding me of her,
        running with someone, walking the route in the opposite direction, almost as if she read where I would be at
        which time. It was 17:47. Call it destiny. The path I was on went uphill because it was the same mountain, just
        from the wrong side. So, I biked down and was motivated to push hard on now the corrected path! Now on the right
        path, the steepest section was yet to come, and luckily, I got this extra motivation. A few minutes later I was
        at the top and took a few photos. On the way back, on the foot at the mountain, I took a wrong turn, but I still
        arrived at the right place. </p>

    <h1>Friday, April 5th 2024</h1>

    <p><em>Evening.</em> A bit less than two weeks ago I wrote a text, “Looking back On getting rejected by my dream
        girl” and there I concluded that talking about my flaws is not sexy. Have I learned my lesson? No. I think there
        is nothing sexier than full surrender to the truth. Today's run started at 15:35 with me biking to the flower
        store where the route starts. I arrived there at 16:07 and started to run, binding my bike to a lamp on the
        busiest road in the village. I started to run and couldn't help to ignore the pain in my lower leg. It was so
        bad I could not run faster than say 8 km/h. Arriving at the mountain I did at 16:40, just 10 minutes later than
        what I promised. From then on, I frequently tried to figure out the map and my phone, I didn't want to take the
        wrong turn again. Of course, the last kilometer in the village was messed up. I knew I wasn't going fast. I
        looked at my phone as I arrived back at my bike and it was 17:21. 1:14 for 8 km! That's shameful, especially
        considering I ran 10 km in 40 minutes just a few days ago. I could try to excuse myself; unknown terrain,
        steepness, hurting feet… The issue is, I did not learn my lesson. God made me fall in love with that girl and
        let her reject me. Then, He made me see blonde girls everywhere, including yesterday. Today I've been sinful in
        the morning and I must assume today's run with its low performance and no beauties was a reminder - that I
        missed a lesson somewhere and need to learn it the hardest way possible. Looking at the level of pain my lower
        legs are in, I think I will need two rest days. Was that the lesson, resting? No, it was not. I know exactly
        where I messed up and did not listen to when I got reminded. I got put in front of my eyes that I'm a nobody
        while being too proud, represented by my low performance, I also got shown the life I could be having if I was
        more disciplined, that's the girls. Will I learn my lessons fast enough? How I will handle two days of not going
        outside, I don't know. Do I have a choice? No. I must accept it and make the best out of it. I guess, that's
        time I can spend on reading, editing videos, or studying for the exams.</p>

    <h1>The weekend.</h1>

    <p>On April 6th and 7th not much happened, since I spent most of the time editing videos and studying for the
        physics exam on the 12th. On the 6th I rested at home and on the 7th, I biked to the route again and walked it.
        On the 7th I also tried to write the text of my 2020 vision. The weather was perfect, sunny, and temperatures
        around 20°C. Altogether, I produced 9 videos and recorded 15, I read approximately 300 pages, have been to the
        gym 3 times, and fixed other issues I was struggling with the moment I wrote the 31st March text, for example, I
        started to eat a lot more to compensate for the active lifestyle. I also rebranded my channel and blog to
        protect my privacy. But there were still some issues with productivity and discipline; I'm not stupid and no
        living soul found out from me that I was home alone, but being home alone eliminates the need to get up early,
        as you can record a video whenever you feel like due to your house being quiet. This lack of pressure however
        made me waste a lot of time. Altogether, I'm a lot further than I used to be a week ago and this week can be
        considered a success, all thanks to the power of despair. From now on, I will continue to create videos and
        study, and I will go to the gym every day, and then bike to the route, walk, or run it, such that I'm at the
        highest point of the route maximum at five in the afternoon. Despair has proven to be very effective in enabling
        progress, giving purpose, and elevating one's will and discipline. </p>
