    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">It's just your mind</span></h1>

    <h1>You thought</h1>

    <p>10 years ago, you could have gone into a forest, enjoyed the golden atmosphere created by the low light angle,
        and rested your mind. You could have meditated just the same as you would do now, except that it would have been
        substantially easier because of social media's absence and missing glowing claws on your mind. There is one
        thing, that changed in that time across the world and no one noticed. </p>

    <p>10 years you could see the condensate of planes everywhere in the air, as a child I often liked to look at them,
        as they were abundant and long lasting. Sometimes these condensate strips created geometrical shapes, as
        multiple planes crossed lines. While being in the forest, you would still be able to hear a <em>distant</em>
        plane from
        15 kilometers away. You could hear a relatively quiet, yet impossible to overhear, for human ears, buzz in the
        air. An almost omnipresent one, although only hearable after the plane has passed you. You could have tried to
        meditate, to live the life you wanted in quietness, yet you would be interrupted by an omnipresent a posteriori
        buzz, noise so to speak. There was nothing you could do about it. That's why it never occupied your mind.</p>

    <p>Yet, no matter how much effort you pay towards planes in the air, you won't hear them, and often you won't even
        see the condensate. That's because of technological improvements and regulatory changes following them.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It's valid to claim that the <a href="blog_44.html">elevated state of mind</a>, spirituality, higher forms of
        being,
        religion, <a href="blog_70.html">awakening</a>, the infinite intelligence, and enlightenment are inaccessible,
        as they symbolize the <em>highest</em> form of
        anything. The aim of this text is to convince you otherwise but under one condition. </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <h1>The cheat code to life</h1>

    <p>If you desire a higher state of being, surely, you should cover the low-level stuff first, and learn how to
        control your desires. Now, you may be asking, what is the most important skill/aspect of reaching worldly
        success? It's competence. I will not explain it further, as I have already done this [link].</p>

    <p>The main message of that text is that brutal competence and intelligence as well as a strong mind in general
        create a solid foundation for your exitance to be valuable in the monetary sense, and therefore other people
        become dependent on you “Hey, you, I know less then you, how do I do that” and you get free “Well, that's
        nonsense. That's how you do it instead.”, “I won't do it, my time is better spent elsewhere” and similar
        freedoms are exclusive to the ultra-competent, as their rarity exceeds their insufficiencies such as arriving
        not on time by a mile. </p>

    <p>After you have figured out how to get competent and free in the process, you will become <em>dangerous</em>, able
        to
        attack life. Unfortunately, you are partially right, it already ends or ended here. Figuring out how to build
        extreme competence (I should clarify that I don't think I achieved it entirely, although I think I am very
        close) is hard and rare. Then finding the path to spirituality is even rarer.</p>


    <h1>Well, you don't need a cheat code</h1>

    <p>If you are unable to achieve these levels of real-world success which results in freedom, there is an
        alternative. It's scaling down and prioritizing your mind. You are still able to meditate for 2 hours a day,
        even if you are broke, it just becomes much less meaningful, because it is better to build competence in that
        case. Most likely you didn't know this when you were 13 years old, that's even better because by now you have
        likely already established a stable source of income and family structures for example, providing you with
        similar levels of safety as the freedom would be created by competence. - You have finally time for it.
        Especially now.</p>

    <h1>Spirituality</h1>

    <p>It starts with breathing correctly, which takes 0 additional seconds. Other things such as doing sports,
        meditation, going for walks, and journaling (or in this case writing) take up never more than 4 hours a day. Now
        you may think that you don't have this time. - Did you think planes would become acoustically invisible 10 years
        ago? No, it was accepted that progress won't exist and that planes will always be loud, providing an omnipresent
        buzz, even though they are distant. Yet now, we arrived at a point where planes are completely quiet and it's
        tempting to think it has always been that case, or not to think about it at all. Time spent developing your soul
        is time well spent after you build a solid foundation. </p>

    <p>The buzz from the plane represents the noise, the conflicts, worries, stress, and all negatives of the mind, the
        buzz is a posteriori, and the buzz is hearable after the plane has already flown by. The plane is distant, just
        as the negatives of the mind, as they are a negative side product, irrelevant on their own. At the same time,
        the omnipresence represents your thoughts, which are filled with distant noise. You can't escape your thoughts.
        The buzz stops you from elevating your level of existence. While the buzz is external in this scenario and
        internal in the explanation, it doesn't have to be the case, because your everyday life consists almost only of
        buzz and so will your mind, although both disappear, both the insignificant aspects of everyday life and
        insignificant thoughts by further development, even if it takes 10 years. Things take time, great things even
        more!</p>

    <p>The plane itself is fast, and leaves behind noise and condensate. That's why it's quiet on the plane itself. It
        attacks and moves forward with speed, high in the air.</p>

    <p>Now you may be a train passenger, or even worse a lost wanderer instead of a plane pilot. That's because you
        haven't taken control so far. Your reality consists in huge chunks, I would say 95%, from your interpretation of
        it, very little is objective, and some philosophies even suggest that everything is entirely subjective and part
        of the infinite intelligence. You need to take responsibility and attack life, you take over the plane instead
        of the lost path by foot, and things will work out your way in most cases. Some things will be forever out of
        your control such as the weather, but as a pilot, you can simply fly over it. </p>

    <p>Related to the concept of your reality being just a product of your mind, here is an example. Have you ever said
        “I should have known it”, “How did I not see it coming”, or “I should have seen it”? Yes, that's because, at
        each moment, there are many things speaking forth, both for and against. It's just a matter of perception, of
        interpretation. This concept of reality consists of your interpretation of it, you are free. It's what you make
        out of the chaos and what you see of it in the first place. That's the infinite intelligence, access to all of
        the chaos, to the whole reality at once.</p>

    <p>Spirituality unlocks new parts of the mind, and therefore a new part of reality itself, as reality is mainly a
        representation of the world. That's why you need spirituality in the first place and that's why it's useful in
        any case - it makes your soul free.</p>
