        content="You may have heard of various methods to declutter your photo collection, but most are too general and don't offer real insights. However, I've got one tip that can make a difference. If you have a bunch of photos, try viewing them regularly and each time, aim to delete a few. But be warned! Viewing them too often might take away their magic and replace your actual memories with the photos themselves. So, the best advice is to create as few photos as possible. Quality over quantity, right?">

    <h1>Time to delete photos</h1>

    <p>I don't know how you take photos. I don't know if you use a phone, a camera, or even a film camera, a drone, or
        how you take your pictures, with a tripod, selfie stick, or maybe even free hand. I don't know whether you
        reserve taking photos for rare occasions or if you take a photo every five minutes. I also don't know whether
        you are a professional, an amateur, or simply someone who takes photos. I also don't know what you do with your
        photos. </p>

    <p>In my experience, there is one thing that everyone has in common. You probably take too many photos. Even if you
        take only 1000 photos per year, over the years it compounds into the 10 000s. But there is a large problem with
        this trend: if you have more photos, their emotional value decreases. And you view them less or don't even view
        them at all. </p>


    <p>In 2018 I was in Belarus, my home country, apparently for the last time, until this point. I took 3 photos.
        Imagine how valuable these 3 photos are to me now, imagine all the emotional attachment I have to these photos!
        They are more valuable than any souvenir. That's all I have, potentially the only the 3 photos for the rest of
        my life. </p>

    <p>This vacation I have been to Spain for 2 weeks, a few days prior I got my first photo camera. I took around 3500
        photos, and most of them were redundant, blurred, or part of time-lapses. Sorting them out was easy. But now I
        am left with 1 060 photos of high quality. How should I decide what photos to delete?</p>

    <p>Well, here I am going to show you the way how I will/have dealt with large amounts of photos.</p>

    <p>The first sieve, so to speak eliminates all images that are blurry, duplicate, overexposed, underexposed, noisy,
        unclear… Like this, the number of photos should be reduced by half, or even more, if you take photos with a real
        camera and don't use your phone.</p>

    <p>I would say there are 3 types of photos. The irrelevant once, the annoying once, and the good once. The good
        photos are self-explanatory. They spike emotions or memories of that specific moment and create a bridge to your
        memories. If I needed to explain annoying photos, here is where it gets interesting because, after the trash
        photos, which have been eliminated in the first sieve, these photos take up a majority of your photos. These are
        photos you took because you thought, you would need them later, for someone else, or because you thought that it
        has artistic value. </p>

    <p>I could give you “the 7 best methods to get rid of useless photos” but the problem with these tips is that they
        are too general and won't give you any more insights. Here is 1 tip, that is able to make a difference. If you
        have a bunch of photos, view them regularly and every time you view them, try to get rid of a few photos. But I
        have to warn you! If you start to view your photos regularly, they will lose their magic, so to speak, and your
        memories will be replaced with the photo itself. That means the real tip is to create as few photos as possible.

    <p>P.S. That's the reason, why I have not uploaded photos of Spain to my website for now!</p>
