    <h1>Make products more addictive</h1>

    <p>Well, I have written a lot about habits and how to get rid of bad habits and how to replace them with good ones.
        I have explained this on multiple occasions, how everything works from your perspective, and how determination
        and higher standards as well as the ratio between pain and pleasure play a role. This time, we will be figuring
        out, how to form bad habits and how to make them inescapable for other people. </p>

    <p>I don't use my phone at all unless expect to learn Chinese or to set an alarm for the next day. This has multiple
        reasons. For one, I have a PC that I can use to write emails or work, and the other reason is the addictive
        nature of mobile apps. Why is it that, as soon as you get bored, you automatically turn on YouTube, before you
        go to sleep you check your messages, and after work, you turn on YouTube again, even though you may not be too
        bored? I assume that you experience something similar. It's 9 pm and you want to go to bed, but then there is
        still your phone, and with no real task, you turn it on.</p>

    <p>This essay is based on the book “Hooked - How to Build Habit-forming Products” by Nir Eyal and my own
        experiences. </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As I started to gain more experience with programming, I continued improving my mental math apps. In October 2022
        I made the most significant update so far because this update included a bunch of modern features. A few days
        ago, I reread this book, and I had to conclude, that even though every significant
        feature existed the app was unusable because it was not designed to be addictive, instead it was designed to be
        functional, meaning addictiveness is necessary to some extent unless you are making a desktop app. Also, the
        addictiveness isn't limited to apps or to digital products, but I may rather not explain it any further, because
        it's very amoral. </p>


    <h2>Concept I - The habit zone</h2>
    <p>Habits are used by your brain to automate complex behaviors. There are 2 systems in your brain, as covered in the
        book “Thinking Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman. The first system is fast and automated and the second system
        requires your attention and active thinking. If you complete a task often enough, it gets automated. For
        example, while tying your shoes used to be connected to conscious effort, now, after a few years have passed,
        this process became completely automated. Another example is my mental math apps: instead of using conscious
        effort to calculate 45 + 16, your brain does that so often that it becomes automated, and you can do it without
        even actively thinking about it. Often habits occur in so-called habit-cues, or as I would call it: easy
        temptations, meaning that habits are combined together, for example brushing your teeth and styling your hair in
        the morning. </p>

    <p>Habits are very good for business because habits automate and therefore replace critical thinking. Did you ever
        thought of buying a toothbrush or did you just do it? Maybe you make it even easier and buy the same toothbrush
        you bought last time? You see, habits make exploitation so much easier. Because of automatization, companies may
        even raise prizes without you noticing, because you have bought their products so often, so you stop caring.</p>

    <p>Most habits take anywhere from a few weeks to develop to a few months, higher frequency makes changes faster.
        Also, older habits are harder to get rid of than new ones.</p>

    <p>This chapter also introduces a concept, which is commonly known in business as the “painkiller vs vitamin”
        question. A painkiller is a product, that solves a direct problem, but a vitamin is a product, that doesn't
        solve any problems on its own, for example, social media, but because everyone starts using it, you also start
        using it and will forget how to live without it. </p>

    <h2>Concept II - Trigger</h2>

    <p>The author Nir Eyal uses the metaphor of a pearl: one tiny dust particle gets inside of the shell, symbolizing
        the problem, and the shell builds multiple layers around it, creating the pearl. </p>

    <p>There are external and internal triggers, and the aim is to make all actions only caused by internal triggers.
        But in order to get started, external triggers are necessary. There are 4 types of external triggers: Paid
        (e.g., ads, or search engines), Earned (e.g., viral videos), and Relationship (e.g. recommendations). But, these
        3 triggers are on their own not very effective, predictive, reliable, or sustainable, because they are either
        expensive or short-lived. The 4th type of trigger is called Owned Trigger and describes things like
        notifications and reminders and is the most reliable in building habits. Even small things like the app's icon
        represent an external trigger. </p>

    <p>Internal triggers are the goal of habits because they shift the responsibility towards you, rather than the
        product. All internal triggers are caused by the deep fear of pain, even if it's hidden below multiple layers.
        Internal triggers can also be caused by other learned behaviors and simply extend them. The aim of triggers is
        to cause action.</p>

    <h2>Concept III - Action</h2>

    <p>According to this book, the action only occurs, if there is enough ability, motivation, and a trigger. Let's
        suppose you brush your teeth before work and after breakfast. Now, you are in a hurry, and that's why you can't
        brush your teeth, even though you have enough motivation and a trigger, your breakfast, the ability was missing.
        Now, another scenario: you feel too tired to brush your teeth in the morning after a long day and a short night,
        even though you have enough time and a trigger, the motivation was missing. Or let's say, you didn't eat
        breakfast, then the trigger is missing.</p>

    <p>Actions are catalyzed if you remove options and friction i.e., instead of adding 10 possible options you use 3
        options and make these options accessible via a single click. My app implements this beautifully, no screen has
        more than 5 options. Altogether, reducing friction turns out to be more rewarding than increasing motivation,
        since motivation comes from within and is much harder to predict. The best way to reduce friction is to make the
        UI, <em>as simple as possible, but not simpler</em> as Einstein would phrase it.</p>

    <p>Motivation can be increased in many different ways, for example with messages, motivational messages, and another
        kind of motivational message: “Only 65 items left in stock, order now” This kind of “motivational” message
        indicated competition, indeed a powerful motivator. Everyone who grew up in the DDR, in East Germany, is saying,
        “If there are a lot of people, there has to be something”, this was referring to constant shortages because many
        people wanted the same products that were partially unavailable due to poor planning, and therefore people had
        enough motivation to stand in lines for hours in order to get some products and to outcompete others. Also, have
        you ever noticed, that you get way better results while doing sports if someone is looking? All amazing sources
        of motivation, that don't require existential thoughts! </p>

    <p>Also, many other concepts can increase motivation to act, you can find every single one in shops. For example,
        decoys, meaning one 1kg of apples cost 1€, 2kg of apples cost 2€ and 1.5kg of apples cost 2.5€. The 1.5kg for
        2.5€ sounds like the best deal, because it breaks patterns. The anchoring effect is commonly known as “on-sale”
        or “-30%” </p>

    <p>If you are close to your goal, motivation increases.</p>

    <h2>Concept IV - Variable Reward</h2>
    <p>Things get boring, the more often you do them, unless you are a physicist, then processes become more interesting
        as you learn to predict them. For example, pressing the light switch always does the same thing, it either turns
        on the light or turns it off, it's linear. Another example: you look at the clock and you will always see the
        time, that's why no one finds looking at the clock interesting. This changes if you go on YouTube because then
        you don't know what you can expect. Infinite scroll makes it even more potent, as seen with the example of
        Pinterest or TikTok. But there is a catch: the reward is not only variable (=unexpected) but also uncertain.
        Most recommendations on YouTube are not suited for your interests, because they provide the necessary noise for
        the real recommendations to shine. </p>

    <h2>Concept V - Investment</h2>

    <p>People like appreciation and especially appreciation of work, and effort. That's why leaving an impact is a
        rewarding strategy. You can accomplish this for example with always increasing numbers, for example, levels.
        Another way to use this strategy is to allow users to spend more money in order to enjoy greater benefits.</p>


    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

    <p>The beginning of this text has been negative, the gained knowledge itself not, and the outro needs to be
        negative, because of the immense damage that addictive, especially addictive digital products do. There is not a
        single person that sincerely thinks that social media or extensive phone usage has made their life better,
        except for people that make a living on these platforms, but even that can be debated. </p>

    <p>“Habit forming” actually means “addictive” and by replacing these words, the destructiveness of this knowledge
        will be a lot clearer. Addictions abuse the mind, body, and behaviors in order to shape them in accordance with
        someone else's interest. Using the technical tools of decades of research, split tests, and big data, companies
        are able to create exploitative and destructive products like TikTok. </p>

    <p>The only way to ethically use this information is by using these dark side effects of the human spirit to make
        the spirit better. For example, addictive learning apps. If one plans to use this knowledge and further
        knowledge in a manipulative way, which I don't hope, this person is not better than the victims of addictive
        products, because this person is equally short-sighted and free from any morals.</p>

    <p>WARNING: DO NOT ABUSE THIS TEXT IN ANY WAY, AND BE A GOOD AND UPRIGHT INDIVIDUAL. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND DO NOT
        USE YOUR KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE THE LIFE OF OTHERS WORSE!</p>
