    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Why not? They prevent catastrophic events!</span></h1>

    <h1>High standards</h1>

    <p>I think that the phrase “high standards” has a negative aftertaste to it, if just a little bit, because it is
        often used in a degrading context. Obviously, most things and people don't reach high standards, that's why they
        are high in the first place, and that's also their whole purpose. Actually, it's a bit more complicated because
        low or middle standards are often not enough. In this text, I will try to remove the negative bit, that slightly
        bitter taste of the phrase “high standards” and convert it into a sweet one, just like chocolate, bitter and
        sweet.</p>

    <p>In my text “Golden Insecurities” I have stated that high standards led to happiness, in the remotest sense. But,
        let's start in a more practical way and get more and more philosophical, as the text progresses. </p>

    <p>Let's say we had no standards, at all. There would be no modern technologies then because take the internet for
        example. The internet's math is standardized, and so are all of the millions of invisible other things. For
        example, the standard for floating numbers (numbers with a fixed length, but a point in a variable place like
        0.1158 or 168979.8) is called IEEE, the standard for data transmission is called TCP, the standard for networks
        is called IP, and so on… What if none of it was set by a central government or organization but “led by the
        people”? We would have no internet because you need to standardize in order to simplify things. Everyone would
        just compete for the best standard, and none would be implemented by all. ISO (International Standardization
        Organization) 216 says, that there is a paper format superior to all. It's the A standard for paper. The A
        standard is the highest of all, because of its mathematical nature. A0 is 1m² in area. And it gets better from
        here because A is the only paper format, that doesn't change its side-by-side ratio, it stays at 1:√2. All the
        other paper formats do change, try it yourself ;-) </p>

    <p>Next to the convenience that is created by standards, there is a more crucial element to standards. You would not
        dare to enter a car or a ship without high standards, because high standards prevent accidents, as they are
        created to prevent catastrophes, that's why only some people have extreme standards because they messed up the
        most, including me. There is a reason for worker safety, environmental standards, safety standards, quality
        standards, and laws, as they are the result of catastrophes. It's commonly known, although oversimplified, that
        the sinking of the Titanic caused an enormous rise in safety standards for ships, it worked. Look at the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_maritime_disasters_in_the_20th_century">wikipedia pages</a> look
        at British disasters. That's what I would call “I have had enough”!
    </p>

    <p>Now, it will get a bit more philosophical, just as I promised. I have written this text for a couple of reasons,
        but the event that caused it was this, let me tell you a little story. I have been creating YouTube since 2021,
        as you already know, and it has been a significant part of my life. In 2020 and 2021 I was in school at a video
        creation and editing club at my school, and my talent got noticed, but in the school year 2021/2022 I did not
        rejoin this club, because of my programming course. In the blog <a href="blog_6.html">“The only way to Live”</a>
        I mentioned a sports
        event at our school that I did not think about because it was too short term, and the original title of this
        text was supposed to be “Thinking long term”. At my school's sports event, the teacher from the video club
        suggested I visit the video club again. I didn't say anything, because the context did not require it, and
        thought about it the whole time - that is the reason for the text <a href="blog_36.html">“Golden
            Insecurities”</a> . I decided to resolve my
        insecurities and constantly thought about it and wrote an email about my journey and what I have learned. I
        decided to link my 2 YouTube channels. But there was a problem. I felt as if my videos were too awkward, weird,
        low quality, or simply didn't deserve any attention. That's where the high standards kick in, maybe I should
        delete the worst videos to be proud of my collection? That's what I did, even though that's inauthentic. </p>

    <p>High standards are harmful in this area, actually, because they promote perfectionism, and perfectionism is the
        killer of perfection. If you set too high standards, especially at the beginning, for example, if you create
        videos for YouTube, you will go nowhere, because practice makes perfect and not perfectionism. You need to have
        high standards if you have failed enough because <em>high standards are the results of many failures and what
            you have learned from them</em>. </p>

    <p>Towards people I have extreme standards, why do you think that is? Because of many catastrophes and high
        standards protect from catastrophes, and regret. </p>

    <p>Look at history. Gandhi had enough of British rule over India and Britain's cruelty. “I have had enough”. Gandhi
        decided that this doesn't need to happen again and should stop. The same thing applies to you, if you messed up
        somewhere or if you face injustice (real injustice, not the type of “injustice” like “gender inequality”). I
        messed up because I neglected meditation in July. My life got worse and now I'm meditating more than ever before
        because I have increased my standards, to prevent future failures.</p>
