    <h1>Math is Philosophy</h1>

    <p>Even though this concept has been mentioned in my previous <a href="blog_31.html">blogs</a> multiple times, I did
        not take my time to
        formulate my arguments because the incentive and event to write it was missing. The event that caused the
        creation of this text, was when I found out that German law prohibits intellectual protection of mathematical
        algorithms, as they are not considered technical improvements, explicitly. </p>

    <p>At first sight, math and philosophy seem unrelated, but if you start to explore the parallels, it will become
        evident, that both fields intertwine on fundamental levels.</p>

    <ol>

        <li>Same origins </li>
        <p>Akin to the shared origins of mathematics and philosophy, the formulation of my viewpoints requires a rooted
            understanding of the interplay between these disciplines. The journey of both fields emerges from the
            inquisitive nature of the human mind, fueling the quest for understanding and discovery. All sciences
            originated from one another, as each science is just a specialized lens to view the world.</p>

        <li>Logic and an axiomatic system</li>

        <p>As mathematics and philosophy find their foundations in reason and logical deduction, so too does the
            structure of philosophical arguments rest upon the bedrock of coherent reasoning. Just as mathematical
            concepts are built on axioms, philosophical systems are also built on axioms, which theorems can be created
            from, just as in math. Parallel to this, both philosophy and math don't allow for contradictory findings to
            exist at the same time - and contradictory things often lead to new discoveries. </p>

        <li>The pursuit of truth</li>

        <p>Whether through mathematical proofs or philosophical inquiry—is the driving force behind both disciplines,
            just as of any other science. The process of finding the truth is essential, because it is the end goal of
            any scientific process, because truth is a solid foundation to work with, and the only one that will pass
            the test of time. <br>Both philosophy and math are built on processes and algorithms to help with the
            discovery of truth. For example, philosophers have thought experiments, and mathematicians have classical
            algorithms or games, for example, the Game of Life by Conway.</p>

        <li>Fundamental/Existential question</li>

        <p>“What is information?”, “What is life” or “What is time?” can be discussed mathematically and philosophically
            at the same time without leading to contradictory answers and if truth is not the aimed result, all things
            can be described this way. </p>

        <li>Unresolvable questions</li>

        <p>There is no way to know what comes after death and there is also no way to know if an algorithm will
            eventually stop for certain often these questions can't be even approximated, because you simply can't know.
        </p>

        <li>Philosophizing about math</li>

        <p>Finally, what's philosophy and math in the first place? Neither of them have accepted definitions. At least,
            math doesn't have one. No one knows if math is invented or discovered, if it's a mental and social construct
            or God itself. If so, then how is a finite universe able to store infinite non-repetitive numbers, like the
            square root of 2? Which infinite mind has the answers? If math is an invented, how is it possible for
            everything to make perfect sense? </p>

            <li>Essencence</li>

            <p>What do philosophy and math try to describe? Only concepts of the mind. Morality and numbers aren't physical.</p>
