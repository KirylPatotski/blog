    <h1>Why I never considered studying medicine <br>and how that changed surprisingly</h1>

    <p>Every parent stepping on earth would have been proud if their children became doctors or medical engineers. When
        introducing oneself, it guarantees respect - rightly so. Medicine is not easy. Doctors sacrifice a lot for their
        profession and that deserves respect. </p>

    <p>Even my mother wanted me to be a doctor or a medical engineer. Not without a reason: I'm highly capable and my
        mother thinks to know me. Yet, medicine never interested me. Why so? That’s what I will explore here. I will
        share my arguments that reveal why medical careers are not a good idea and why I strongly advise against
        medicine for most, even if those are interested. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Who is this text for?</strong></em> To those of you who are not unshakably sure they want to go into
        medicine. If you are certain, then good luck with your path. Respect. If you have been in medicine for decades,
        congratulations, and I hope your life is free of regret. Thanks for your dedication. But for those of you who
        are in a foggy situation, this text should be the lighthouse. This text is for those a bit unsure and with other
        options in consideration. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1cm;">For example, a capable friend of mine considered medicine practically his entire life
        but then decided to become
        a chemist at the last moment. The girl who didn’t want me was one if not the brightest girls at school and was
        split between becoming a teacher or a doctor. This text is exactly for those who are a bit uncertain.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Why should you listen to me?</strong></em> I want to be a businessman. Above all, that’s stressful
        and will require me to give all of my energy - daily. In that sense, being a businessman and a doctor is
        similar. Both require lifelong studying and true mastery lies within being a student. Sometimes everything gets
        reinvented. In medicine and high-end business, there will be moments when difficult decisions have to be made
        and at a certain point, that’s the only thing left to do. Hence, business and medicine are similar. So, why
        should you listen to me? I thought everything through regarding my life and it proves itself correct. I know my
        plan, the sacrifices, and the tradeoffs. I live a decently exhausting version of life right now and observe
        myself. I also gained plentiful experience in making life-changing decisions, I planned my life a long time ago.
        Furthermore, I'm an experienced writer and thus have extraordinary reflective and rhetoric capabilities. </p>

    <h1>Let’s make a tactical decision</h1>

    <p><em><strong>The rewards are the same everywhere.</strong></em> It’s easy to get distracted with all of the status
        you’ll gain as a doctor. You’ll be easily in the top percentile of society. Doesn’t it feel great to feel
        recognized and doesn’t it feel great to help people while being paid well? But let us not forget that status and
        salary are relatively irrelevant. Helping people is also irrelevant. Why is helping people irrelevant? Because
        every job contributes to society. A teacher is helping society just like a doctor. Furthermore, recognition,
        status, a high salary, the feeling that you help people, and the feeling that you are useful can be obtained in
        any realm of human endeavor. For example, being a businessman brings you status, money, and a deep sense of
        purpose, i.e. feeling useful. Being a teacher brings those rewards as well. Even being a housewife can bring
        extraordinary fulfillment. You get used to the rewards of your respective career very fast and they don’t differ
        too much across careers, hence they are irrelevant. Additionally, rewards alone are not enough to create
        long-lasting motivation and purpose.</p>

    <p><em><strong>What's at the center?</strong></em> Now, if all rewards are the same everywhere, what should you look
        at? At the center. Chess starts with the player’s attempts to dominate the center. Let's go back to life. To be
        a seasoned tactician, look at what you will be actually doing every day. Think of the task you’re supposed to
        enter a flow with. Look at your daily tasks and decide whether they excite you. </p>

    <p><em>“As a doctor, I want to get in a flow while smelling blood and while cutting flesh. I want to study for ten
            years to neglect my future family just to get an even more exhausting job. I enjoy the hospital's piercing
            smell and its depressive interior design.” – text #119</em></p>

    <p><em>Do you know the daily tasks?</em> For a doctor, the daily tasks are well known. If not, an internship can
        give insight, though they often have nothing to do with the real job. Because internships can be misleading, you
        may revert to theoretical and philosophical findings to determine the truth. A step further, talk with people
        about it. If you want to go above and beyond, go to the specialist, call him, and tell him that you want to pay
        him a decent amount of cash for a compressed version of his wisdom tailored to you. Asking for advice from the
        right person can give insights powerful enough to transform lives in a single hour. </p>

    <p><em>Now, why should flow be important?</em> The answer is simple. If you can’t get in a flow with a task, it will
        bring exactly zero fulfillment and instead drain you. It seems as if humans contradict the laws of physics
        because the flow makes you feel energized. Hence, if cannot enter a flow with a task, you have a problem. Time
        passes differently when filling out documents compared to driving at night, right? I think you don’t want your
        job to feel as draining as sitting in a waiting room without a phone, you need the flow. Some tasks, for
        example, writing are outright impossible without the flow, because otherwise there’s too much tension and the
        thought cannot leave the mind. If you can’t get in a flow and your job feels draining, a bit of status will be
        completely irrelevant. Can getting in a flow be learned? Unfortunately, whether you get into a flow is as
        individual as who you can fall in love with or not. It’s possible, but not guaranteed.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Are you the right person for said center?</strong></em> To embody calculated precision, think of
        whether you are compatible with the flow task. Frankly, I don’t know what kind of person wants to see suffering
        and cut flesh as their daily task in the first place. I can’t comprehend how someone can feel attracted to the
        pain of others. Not too long ago, I sat on a train and some medicine students were chatting. One of them was
        even hot, though she was a brunette. They were not talking about business, love, or even parties, instead, about
        what types of wounds there are. Are you attracted to that? I couldn’t do that and most others couldn’t. That is
        not to frown upon, but to illustrate. Not everyone is built the same way. For example, most people can’t
        understand what in the world must be important enough to get me up at four without an alarm. On the other hand,
        I cannot comprehend how some can enjoy relaxation. While my lifestyle may sound very cool, the reality is, that
        most couldn’t live it unless they had no other option. Yet, many people waste their time trying to emulate
        what’s perceived to be cool, just to notice after plenty of wasted effort that they are fooling themselves. Live
        by the deepest realization. Can you get in a flow with blood and pain? Is that the daily task you truly want?
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Is the environment right for you?</strong></em> My parents, school, and everyone else wanted me to go
        into science. That’s the direction my life was heading. At 5 years old I was passionate about the universe and
        at 7 about nuclear physics. It looked as if I was going to be a scientist. At the age of 13, I started to desire
        being a businessman and then at the ages of 14 and 15, I was a bit split between being a scientist and an
        entrepreneur. But then, guess what happened? I had an internship at my local university and I hated it. I’ve
        been misled my entire childhood. I hated the internship, for example, the atmosphere, the design of the
        buildings, the tasks but also the people. Surprisingly, I had nothing in common with those other scientists and
        students. I could not see myself growing up to be such a nerdy beta. Being the person only good at one thing,
        which is most people, was the last thing I wanted, how ironic that’s considered balance. This is not personal,
        but I don’t like most engineers, electricians, and stem professors character-wise. The way I think and act is
        incompatible with that of a physics geek. Good luck with a flow then! I once wrote a 5,000-word essay on this
        topic, which is unpublished, so describing the differences further would break this text. But generally, do you
        get along with the people there and the atmosphere? Personally, I would feel better in a school than in a
        sterile hospital that has this piercing smell on a night shift. </p>

    <p><em><strong>What are you doing right now?</strong></em> Let’s return to becoming a sound. Why am I unshakably
        certain I will be a businessman and others doubt their desires? Because business is all I do. For years now, I
        have started and finished projects and built skills. For example, in the last week, I practiced speaking
        extensively. Analogous to this, if you obsess over medicine already, you should pursue it. Then you know clearly
        if you can get in a flow with it or not. If you are not obsessed with medicine already, chances are, you never
        will. You cannot choose what to develop an interest in, just as you cannot decide who to fall in love with. Do
        you want to do something that will not interest you or be together with someone who you don’t love? Exactly. So,
        you can’t know whether something will interest you at all. You can’t know whether you’ll gain the ability to
        enter a flow or not. Sure, you can fall in love just as you can develop passion, and it is likely - but there’s
        no guarantee. If you don’t occupy yourself with medicine all day long already, it is not currently your purpose
        and hence chances stand against you. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Live by the deepest realization.</strong></em> You may be tempted to think that being a doctor is
        more than just worrying about wounds. Sure, being a doctor is also about filling out documents, but again,
        that’s every job so that’s irrelevant. It is a universal law, life consists of filling out documents. If blood
        scares you a bit, but you view it as the price for entry, you are lying to yourself. Seeing blood is the entire
        job, not a price to entry. Do not attach your ego to decisions and make them living by the deepest realization.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Consider this.</strong></em> Finally, your self-awareness may be zero. You can find out whether you
        have self-awareness or not if (1) things and feedback offend you, (2) you make your emotions dependent on what
        others think, (3) you let life dictate your mind, (4) you avoid responsibility and think that people are not
        radically responsible for their lives, (5) you don’t do sports (I mean real sports), avoid the hardship of any
        kind in general, (6) you are addicted to something, for example, you use social media just consuming, (7) you
        are negative, (8) you are a thinker or dreamer, i.e. like to be right and live in your fantasy and finally (8)
        you don’t realize that when you are tired or hungry your thoughts and emotions start to change. If you have zero
        self-awareness, your decisions tend to be harmful. All of that is because (9) you refuse to meditate, reflect,
        and journal. If you cannot make clear decisions, you have a problem and no one can help you because
        self-awareness is rare. There may not be enough time left to summon self-awareness, but to sincerely reflect,
        you’ve always got time. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Finally, think long term.</strong></em> If you start to reflect, make the subject of your mediation
        your changing priorities. Just because you can study diligently today, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to
        study for the next decade. There’s no guarantee you will not lose interest in medicine. Also, what makes you
        think that your priorities will stay the same? Now with 18, you may think that helping people in medicine is
        noble. With 35, that could be irrelevant and you’ll have to handle other priorities, especially as a woman. Now
        you may desire status, but this will change once you mature. Now you are likely to think that fulfillment comes
        from the job. Will you think the same with 50 or will family bring fulfillment with 50? Yet, with 50 it may be
        too late to change things. Especially with zero self-awareness, it’s impossible to predict how you will change.
        However, change is guaranteed. You can’t know what life is going to give you. That’s why it’s interesting. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Be willing to pay the price.</strong></em> And… let’s not forget being a doctor is hard. You can
        forget about family. Studying for a decade is a huge sacrifice. You have to be willing to pay the price. For a
        bit of status, that must surely be worth it, right? </p>

    <p><em><strong>And yes, look at the data.</strong></em> Do you want night shifts? How long will you have to study?
        Where will you work? How much will you earn?</p>

    <p>So, should you become a doctor? It depends. Do you want to give your life to this profession? If you are not
        unshakably sure, don’t do it. If you have zero self-awareness, be cautious. If you don’t enjoy flesh, blood, and
        pain, forget it. If you're not already immersed in medicine all day, there's no guarantee you'll become
        interested in it. Try not to worry too much about what your parents will think. Don’t look at status, money, and
        other rewards, because they are universal and don’t create sustained motivation. If you don’t want to give your
        life to something difficult, there’s no point in trying to pursue it. Also, consider your changing priorities.
        Something difficult is only doable with purpose, with burning desire. Only with a strong enough why will you be
        able to stand almost any how. However, if you are uncertain, that ‘why’ simply doesn’t exist. Also, be willing
        to pay the price. Live by the deepest realization. </p>

    <p>Even if one can picture becoming a doctor, the dream being crisp and clear, mere feet away from coming true,
        sometimes that dream turns into a nightmare. Such is the nature of dreams. </p>

    <h1>Guess who is going into medicine</h1>

    <p>I never looked forward to university. As you may know, I don’t like people too weak to sit upright.
        Unfortunately, universities are full of them, especially in computer science. Computer science was what I was
        about to study and noted that I didn’t write ‘I wanted to study computer science’. </p>

    <p>Ever since the painful failure and consequent abandonment of my apps, in September, I haven’t touched my
        computer. I noticed how I diverged from the identity of a programmer rather quickly. (More in the text ‘A new
        identity’) I’m now at a point where I’m the opposite of thinking like an autist, being awkward, and caring about
        digital stuff. The only remains from my previous self are a long list of little accomplishments, the time spent
        wisely on developing myself, and an inventory of skills coupled with powerful life lessons. I have zero desire
        to program and slowly morph into what I despise most. My wish to study computer science never existed in the
        first place. Studying computer science was to please my parents. I didn’t believe in it since I was a decent
        programmer already and because all the businessmen I talked to advised against university. Also, did you know
        that I want to be a businessman instead of a programmer? Programming was a means to an end. And I was about to
        shape my life around it. I viewed studying computer science to let time pass so that I could work on my business
        while distracting and pleasing my parents. That’s not a good start. </p>

    <p>I disagreed to become a beta, an invisible life is legitimately one of my worst fears. But today, my mother told
        my grandmother that this computer science stuff is for dorks and nerds. I mean what I say and say what I mean.
        It’s painful to be around these people, spare yourself of their way of life! They live like crackheads,
        programmers only have a computer for work, a computer to game, and nothing else. Furthermore, what my
        grandmother found out is that this computer science stuff brings negative status because of how disgusting the
        majority of programmers are. This computer science stuff doesn’t bring employment either, just as the
        businesspeople told me and that’s what my grandmother realized as well. In short, programming is for betas and I
        wasn’t going to become one of them. I would be wasting my life and excellent grades on it. </p>

    <p>Since my desire to study this computer stuff was zero and I did not see myself as a programmer anyway, I didn’t
        resist much when my mother said I should instead study ‘medical engineering’. Molecular chemistry and especially
        not organic chemistry are options because I don’t want to look at 40 as if I'm 55, I don’t want to pay with my
        health. Medicine is not an option either because I don’t get in a flow while filling out documents and neither
        do I get in a flow while cutting people. That’s what I wrote the first half of the text about. Neither do I
        expect to ‘get a crush’ on blood. </p>

    <p>So, what is medical engineering? That’s dealing with robotic, radioactive, computer, and biological stuff coupled
        with math. It’s not a direct job like programming; instead, it has leadership potential because you learn a
        broad range of things. Do I like sterile hospitals? No. But, the thing is, neither do I like recording videos
        and I still do it*. </p>

    <p>I like the redemption, the sweet certainty that I will never be a programmer, surrounded by betas, or a geek
        myself. Furthermore, I’m sure I will like doing something real. Since my personality shifted so drastically, I'm
        glad I have something new and not something stuck to my old identity, I think, medicine matches who I am much
        more. </p>

    <p>I don’t know if you know it or not, but I don’t care about most things. I only truly care about business
        pursuits, girls, health, and some of my family members. I don’t care about anything else, I don’t care about the
        opinions of others, and neither do I care about the weather. It is this exact indifference that made me
        open-minded and as a result, propelled me forward. I’m not very open-minded, because a law of the universe and a
        maxim of mine says: do not try to fix things that work. Since this computer crap wasn’t a welcomed solution, I
        demonstrated enough open-mindedness. Luckily, my mother cared about me since university is not part of the
        things I care about. Still, maybe I should have cared... </p>

    <p>Anyway, now you may worry that I may up liking medical engineering and it ends up killing my exorbitant
        ambitions. Do not worry, I don’t believe that this is going to happen. I understand very well that it may to
        late to create videos just as it was too late to create apps. I understand very well, perhaps more than my
        parents want to believe me, that in the last few years, biotech saw some breakthroughs. Getting to know this
        stuff may save my ambitions since I hear of things I didn’t even know existed, with magnitudes fewer
        competitors. New things enhance creativity and enhanced creativity means, among other things, better texts.
        Maybe I will indeed end up working a job and not have my own business, that is likely even, but having a job
        does not mean one can’t tackle the impossible. </p>

    <p>Furthermore, I think studying this will develop me more as a person**. I didn’t think so with this computer
        science stuff, I feared it would regress me. I want to give you a little categorical imperative: if you can’t
        flex with it at a party, don’t pursue it. Can you flex with becoming a geek at a party? No. Can you flex with
        writing 400.000 words in the last 500 days while going to the gym and doing pull-ups with 30 kg of extra weight?
        Definitely, but people may start to envy you. Can I flex with this medicine stuff? Perhaps. It has substance and
        strikes my curiosity, even if only very mildly, though I legitimately do not care about photosynthesis. It
        aligns with who I am and how I view myself and I'm much more convinced of that than before I started to reflect.
        And now I'm excited to go to university. </p>

    <p>*You will not understand. Why should you do something no one forces you to, where success is not guaranteed and
        not even expected, which you don’t like? If I only knew… I wanted to build an audience to make my business grow
        faster back when I was 13, … but truly, can that motivate me for so long? There must be something beyond it.
        Perhaps, it is the desire for darkness that originates from the dislike of boredom.</p>

    <p>**Today I got a new wardrobe and I no longer wear the things where everyone would think my parents don’t like me.
