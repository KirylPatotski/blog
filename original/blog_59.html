    <h1>And then it hit me</h1>

    <p><em>Part 2 of <a href="blog_50.html">"Failures kill"</a></em></p>

    <p>It was 370 days ago that I published my first <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiryl.arithmetic">app</a>. It was a mental math app. It was the result of, at that point
        1.5 years of continuous effort towards my entrepreneurial journey, because I had to start somewhere. After I
        continued to develop the app continuously and also started to build an audience as well as a brand it seemed
        inevitable to start YouTube. But I wasn't ready to start YouTube even in the winter of 2023. On the other hand,
        I was able to start advertising very much, because I thought that my apps reached a level where using them would
        become enjoyable. So, this story starts in February 2023, at that point, I have been procrastinating to
        advertise, or at least trying to advertise for a very long time.</p>

    <p>I procrastinated with this task because I lacked knowledge and was too scared because of what this advertising
        may reveal about my path. But then, I set myself a deadline to keep myself accountable and started to advertise
        and failed. </p>

    <p> <a href="blog_50.html">Then I overcame my own fears and failed anyway in August 2023, after 6 months. </a></p>

    <p>...</p>
 
    <p>But now is where the story takes a turn because already a week has passed and I tried many ad campaigns, and
        video ads and they failed. I think my expectations were unrealistic because nothing desirable comes easy and
        great things take time. My specific approach was probably wrong.</p>

    <p>I wondered what to improve and laid a plan to try out new ad formats, after all, I tried video ads. I created a
        little matrix to get more systematic about it. I could try this and that, videos, images text…</p>

    <p>And then it hit me…</p>

    <p>What the hell was I doing here? I didn't intend to become an advertiser, I wanted to become a YouTuber. Because
        of this ad stuff, I didn't upload to YouTube for 2 weeks. That means I was “productive on the wrong thing” which
        is the same thing as procrastination. In my summer holidays, I had 2 internships and many other things which are
        unrelated to YouTube. But then I realized, what am I doing this for? I know that I should be focused on YouTube,
        instead, I drifted far away from it. That means internships and advertising were actually procrastination, just
        on another level. That's because these are not tasks with the highest return in the long run.</p>
