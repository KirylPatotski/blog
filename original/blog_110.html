    <h1>Peasant morality</h1>

    <p><em><strong>I don't want to peak at a party.</strong></em></p>

    <p>I love myself when I don't despise myself. I don't despise myself as I don't regret anything. Most people will
        say that their younger version is stupid. I would say my past self was brilliant in comparison to the rest. When
        you ask the average person what they were thinking about when they were 14 or what they remember from this
        forming year of their life, most people will struggle to come up with anything outside of fabricated events,
        because they seemly weren't conscious and still aren't. They probably mistake consciousness for a voice in their
        head - spoiler, it's far from it. </p>

    <p>I live in Germany and a surviving communist tradition is youth consecration, a secular event for 14-year-olds to
        celebrate their de-facto adulthood. I knew that this wasn't something authentic I wanted to do and I had no
        problems resisting the peer pressure surrounding it. I didn't desire to peak at a party. I don't know how a
        person can desire to let life happen to them instead of gripping life with claws. I refused to participate, I
        knew I didn't want to have this memory. I couldn't fathom constructing myself a life where I follow what the
        crowd does. At that time, I was already incompatible with the rest, so why should I follow and pretend as if I
        was setting sails for an ordinary life? When I look back on the time I was 13 or 14 years old, I already had
        done a few things no normal person would do, I had a programming course for adults and I skipped 9th grade.
        Sounds short, but this was more than enough to do, I have more than enough memories, and none of them were
        external or inauthentic. <em>I didn't want to peak at a party.</em> Yes, it may also have played a role that I
        was deeply
        hurt and full of aggressive traumas and with little bondage to the other people my age, but this would be an
        incomplete representation. Do I regret not going to that event? No, everyone who is not a complete peasant will
        tell you that it was so far below expectations that it crushed them. </p>

    <p><em><strong>The 2 paths.</strong></em> Fast-forwarding a few years, I'm 16 and I'm grateful for the things I've
        done. And I think the evaluation of personality types is complete nonsense. Temperaments, hobbies, desires,
        goals, opinions, appearance, … they all are irrelevant. There are 4 personalities and 4 only. There are idiots,
        losers, respectable people, and winners. Idiots, they have never thought a single thought. Losers fail at
        everything they do so they don't even try and drag others down instead. Respectable people will help others and
        try, but may not succeed themselves. Then there are winners. Actually, we can summarize the former 3
        personalities into the loser category, because their lives strand on the same beach and we can rightfully call
        them losers. So, there are winners and losers. </p>

    <p>Most people react and some people create. Most people buy and others produce. Most people watch and others act.
        Most people let life happen to them, some grip their life and attack it to a point where it has no other option
        than going their way. And yes, some people pave roads, others walk on them. Most people orient themselves, and
        some others explore.</p>

    <p>There is no 'better' path in itself and there never will be, because a society survives on people who like to
        stay at home while others risk their lives for the sake of exploration. The slaves are constant, while the
        masters are changing, without change there is no adaptation, and without constancy, there is no stability. The
        most important quality therefore is how well a person handles the fear of the unknown. Some people don't find
        pleasure and meaning in exploration when it robs comfort, what risk is everything for? “It is easy to be
        immature [and to remain passive]” Kant said. Why not use the paths paved by others, why take the risk to do
        something on your own? This common doctrine makes sense from the perspective of the normal person and I don't
        desire to talk bad about them. However, for a minority of us, that's not the right way to live. Some people
        don't want to let life happen to them, they want to happen to life. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Beyond peer pressure.</strong></em> I want to make a wild claim, as you won't find it anywhere on the
        internet as the internet is for losers. A strong link exists between being conscious and desiring to be a
        winner. Let's look at what consciousness means. It means that you start to see yourself as a trapped being for
        the first time, you start to think and to see and everything stops making sense. A goldfish is too stupid to
        grasp what freedom means since it is completely unconscious. Consciousness brings its problems and let's just
        say life becomes very complicated. However, if you have complete consciousness, something interesting will
        happen: you will chase the unknown, you will hunt adventure. The explanation for it is quite simple, if you are
        unconscious, you will be able to accept and embrace a dull life, like the yellow-green parrot that does nothing
        different than swing in its little cage in a living room with nothing changing and with practically infinite
        safety. Almost every living being wants to live likewise. Fish are living in schools, where none of them ever
        think a single thought, and most people are comparable to this level in their sophistication of thought. No
        wonder they find it impossible to resist what others tell them and what other people expect from them, they
        can't resist peer pressure, as they are an embodiment of the hive. Peer pressure is the dominating force of the
        unconscious, while the conscious is dominated by the force of meaning. They are exactly opposed because peer
        pressure resembles safety and consciousness constitutes the unknown. </p>

    <p>Consciousness is also linked to intelligence, if someone has thoughts so precise that they split atoms, they will
        be unable to live like a fish in its not-too-clear water. It's hard to draw a line where consciousness and peer
        pressure transition. </p>

    <p><strong><em>When you have consciousness, your life is going to get complicated.</em></strong> When you have a
        high level of consciousness, there are 3 main paths you can sail along. </p>

    <p><em>Rejection of the extraordinary.</em> The most common path is the rejection of the extraordinary life and the
        attempt to live it normally. You try to kill the consciousness you've got and numb yourself. This inner conflict
        will remain forever, that's why you see many intelligent people with severe mental disorders, such as
        depression. This is also the reason why many quote-on-quote dumb people seem to be happier; they don't have
        these problems. That's why common people find depression to be inevitable for intelligent people. The people
        taking this path have 'normal lives', with normal jobs, but they suffer deeply, this is the person that could
        have been something but instead goes to the pub on a weekend and then comes home to a wife that is no longer
        attracted to one. A lot of scientists live this life and I doubt they are genuinely happy. </p>
    </li>

    <p><em>Excel at the game you've been born into.</em> Another path some people take is not a desperate attempt to
        live an ordinary life, but rather a path where you try to beat the game you've been born in, you aren't a school
        fish in the but rather an eagle that flies in the air, far above and hunts fish whenever it feels like it. That
        means you live like a billionaire. You try to beat the system you're in, you try to try to win the game everyone
        fails at and you try to gain your fulfillment from here. The billionaire is just a modern example. Explorers,
        astronauts, conquerors, kings, presidents, and revolutionaries are other representations of the same phenomenon,
        i.e. have an overlap in this area, they express their consciousness by mastering the game they're playing. I
        think, if everyone had the choice, no one would choose to live life as a peasant, but generally people are happy
        with what they have because they can't imagine anything else. </p>

    <p><em>Embrace authenticity.</em> The third option some people take is a life of pure excellence, where you only do
        the things, your consciousness wants you to do, without a care for anything inauthentic. A lot of writers,
        artists, and monks choose this way of life because it's not tied to anything. In the modern world, one type of
        explorer becomes vital. In the age of abundant information, synthesizers are vital, those take information and
        create wisdom out of it. </p>

    <p>None of these 3 groups is more or less conscious, they all express it equally drastically, some even to a point
        where every second feels like pain if you don't do what your consciousness dictates - hence, some people, both
        'dumb' and 'smart' ones call it the worst disease out there. However, I disagree, because recently I've lost
        consciousness for ~2 weeks, due to some internships my parents wanted to apply me to for the summer but I didn't
        see it to be something authentic. I noticed that life is not worth living without consciousness and I already
        knew that every second of existence only feels painful if you have a high level of consciousness and still do
        the wrong things. Perhaps you've tried to be a scientist while authentically desiring the life of an
        entrepreneur or the simple life of a writer. I also can't imagine every life to feel bad if you serve others,
        love with your full heart, and are in a permanent flow, doing what you are excellent at. A life, where you write
        as if no one is reading, speak as if no one is listening, and love, as if you've never been hurt. </p>

    <p>Let me reveal another interesting facet of consciousness. Mindful people have more time than others, for them, a
        second passes, without exaggeration, ten times slower than for a normal person. Hence, it's impossible to live
        an ordinary life; a life of reaction instead of creation, buying instead of producing, watching instead of
        acting. There is nothing you want more than a deep authentic meaningful life.</p>

    <p>What makes those non-negating paths desirable for people with elevated levels of consciousness? It all comes down
        to the unknown. When you start to become conscious, the unknown stays fear-inducing, but not trying to discover
        the unknown is going to remain even scarier, it's better to take a torch to explore a dark room than it is to
        shut the door in your cozy place. Across many cultures, millennia, and continents consciousness stands for the
        masculine and the unknown for the feminine. You see, an increase in consciousness, i.e. in masculinity results
        in a strong desire to live a life outside of norms, to explore the unknown. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Not peasant moral, but the moral of a master</strong></em></p>

    <p>Peasants, slaves, servants, proletarians, … they all consume and like to make themselves comfortable. They don't
        like to face the fear of the unknown, hence, they rely on someone above them. But, (1) You don't want to peak at
        a party. (2) You have to choose an extraordinary life, there is a life of winners and one for losers. (3) The
        desire for the unknown is created by consciousness. To remove the clouds of greyness, I want to cite, Kant's “An
        Answer to the Question, what is Enlightenment.” It mentions guardians who think and the peasants who don't, but
        it ignores the reason for laziness and passivity, a lack of consciousness. </p>

    <p><em>“Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one's
            understanding without guidance from another. This immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack
            of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another. […] Laziness
            and cowardice are the reasons why so great a proportion of men, long after nature has released them from
            alien guidance […] nonetheless gladly remain in lifelong immaturity, and why it is so easy for others to
            establish themselves as their guardians. It is so easy to be immature.”</em></p>

    <p>You have to think for yourself and assess everything. You are going to do it automatically with higher levels of
        consciousness. It's only the peasant moral that's dictating that thinking too much only makes you worry. Any
        peasant will tell you that you can't always be thinking but also need to turn off your brain once in a while to
        watch a movie.</p>

    <p><em><strong>You start to obsess over your attention.</strong></em> Any person who has a consciousness high enough
        to transition from servant to master will be paying close attention to everything, and guard their most valuable
        asset, which is their attention. If you watch something it means that you pay attention to it - simple, right?
        Now, what does reality mean? I want to give you a definition that every 8-year-old will understand. Reality is
        what you see, feel, hear, smell and taste. To be practical, the reality is what the world is as perceive it, as
        you are limited. Taking this argument a step further, what happens when you watch a movie? It's going to occupy
        your mind for the moments you consume as well as moments beyond. Now, if you look at picturesque scenery, it
        occupies your reality just as much, because your brain gets filled with this impression. That means, essentially
        anything that occupies your brain, automatically occupies your mind, and hence it dictates your reality, even if
        just for a brief moment. Logically, if you pay attention to something, it becomes your reality. The question
        remains, whether you want something to be part of your reality or not. Every fabricated reality can be regarded
        as hostile with only a few exceptions. </p>

    <p>I don't know if it's entirely clear what I mean. That means something that robs my attention without my will
        feels as disgusting as if my woman was raped.</p>

    <p>Most people would enjoy getting mentally raped, they want their attention to be stolen and abused. They want to
        kill their time. They like music robbing their attention, they like movies robbing their attention, they like
        spending 4 hours a day on their phone, they like spending time on social media, and they like having hostile
        penetrations everywhere in their reality. I guess there is no hope for these people anymore because any person
        who used to have consciousness is now dead from within. Beyond the age of ~25, it's practically impossible to
        revert the damage caused by raped attention, as the brain slows down massively in the speed of its development
        beyond this age. Those people could have had a life unreachable to most and they missed their chance because
        they found sending pictures to their friends on social media more important and never generated a will strong
        enough to stop their attention from getting robbed. It's sad to see that even people who are doing good in
        school waste their time on mind-numbing social media instead of taking control of their lives. For those people,
        there is no hope either.</p>

    <p>Do you know, how I end every video of mine? <em>“The choice is yours.”</em> - They have made theirs and now they
        are
        heading towards a meaningless life. They will be letting everyone around them down, just because they are too
        stupid to think for themselves and let other people indoctrinate into them that this is normality. No. How I
        live the way life was designed to be lived, without anything I don't want robbing my attention and enslaving me
        - I'm the master of my mind. There is no only true way to live, but living with your attention exploited by
        others against your interest is a wrong one. You can't live and metaphorically worship a golden calf instead of
        the true God. Perhaps you should stop listening to people who tell you otherwise because they are complete
        losers themselves. Those are the people who watch and don't produce. If you consume, you become nothing more
        significant than a number on the screen of a winner. You will become reduced to a subscriber, employee,
        follower, or user, or if we include more radical terms, you will become one more casualty in a statistic who
        lived for truly nothing. But at least, you will live in comfort and safety, or at least you are going to think
        that just because you cannot focus. History never cares about peasants and what they think. It's only mindful
        people that matter, those who are inventing, exploring, and conquering.</p>

    <p>There is a new type of winner emerging in the age of information. The age of information creates an abundance of
        information and therefore a lack of wisdom. Normally people profited from what they knew, i.e. “I know how to be
        a smith and you don't” but now everything can be self-learned. In the new age of information, everyone has
        access to the same things. So, in a sea of information, synthesizers are the new winners. Those who control
        their attention, think wisely put every piece of the puzzle together, and share their knowledge with others.
        Create content, don't consume. </p>

    <p>Hence, it is vital to spend your attention wisely. Choose where it goes with care. I your attention needs to
        rest, spend time in nature or staring at the ceiling. The ability to focus is what establishes the certainty of
        success. Do not allow your attention to be stolen from you by being passive, do not allow for your attention to
        dictate your reality to someone else gain. You must not give your attention to entertainment, only to content
        that elevates the soul. Your attention is finite.</p>

    <p><em>Why I take great photos.</em> I used to walk completely passively, sunk in my thoughts. As I started to
        create time-lapses at the age of 13, I started to pay attention to prettier things since I conditioned myself to
        search for aesthetic things to record. Suddenly I started to see beauty everywhere and my reality became much
        prettier as a whole. This is what controlling what you pay attention to means. </p>

    <p><em><strong>What the unknown brings.</strong></em> The pursuit of the unknown, makes you enjoy discomfort,
        challenge, and stress, as those things resemble progress. The unknown can bring anything, including pain,
        material rewards, attraction from the opposite sex, and status - that's what legendary means. Many explorers are
        treated as heroes. But the utmost important aspect of the unknown is that it brings fulfillment, the best form
        of happiness. </p>

    <p>The choice, it is yours. You can gain consciousness and it starts with meditation. Before you have not meditated,
        you cannot entitle yourself to criticize this text. Although … I don't know at the end of the day, if it's that
        great to never fit in anywhere. Being part of something is vital and being outside of everything often does not
        end well, when you fail to become a master, others will make sure you know that you are a slave.</p>
