    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Fix traumas and leverage your mind</span></h1>

    <h1>Move on</h1>

    <p>It feels as if… having resolved every trauma is the only state of mind that existed and was possible in the first
        place. That isn't self-evident and not easy, unfortunately, to achieve, and it took me 3.5 years to resolve 7
        years of traumatic experiences, every year from 2012 to 2019. From 2020 to April 2023. In the end, it took 1
        night to change everything and to resolve every single one. From that day on my life started to really feel
        differently. Unfortunately, I censor my diary because it should not contain anything that could hurt me when
        exposed, so the exact day in April is unknown, but I think that it is the 10th of April.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you have noticed that my texts never take place earlier than 2020.</p>

    <p>I long thought about how I should start this text and I thought that it may even be better to record a
        non-scripted YouTube video but I think it is better to do it in text first as it's easier to add new ideas.</p>

    <p>First of all, what's a trauma? A trauma is defined as a memory causing negative emotions for more than 18 months.
        Now you may be tempted to assume that that's normal, common, omnipresent, and self-evident. However, it is
        possible to have no traumas entirely and you know that you got rid of you wonder why (I know it sounds harsh)
        you got emotional about it in the first place. Having traumas is like falling in love, as it will chase you
        emotionally with the only difference that it will destroy you and hunt you forever. Unless you fix it and
        recognize this as a problem in the first place. </p>

    <p>In the years before 2020, I have experienced everything on the palette of trauma, as I had a <em>long life</em> already
        early on. I experienced the death of close relatives, loss of roots, single parenthood, getting bullied,
        bullying myself, long-lasting, stress along with other high levels of mental and emotional suffering, although
        not entirely traumatic because not these things wouldn't be related to single events. By the age of 11, my soul
        had already been damaged for 6 years and it was more than enough. </p>


    <p>Not entirely social in the first place because I radically differed from all the other kids, I stopped
        socializing entirely until 2023 and even now I feel the effects of it, the cost of having a hard childhood with
        many traumas. </p>

    <p>In the summer of 2022, when I already had been programming, creating videos, and working on my future, thinking
        long-term, I still had a bunch of bad habits, The most relevant for this video is the bad habit of YouTube
        shorts. While it never made me skip work, since work was still better than free time, I used to watch YouTube
        shorts for 2-4 hours a day, while idle, for example in the hours of from 14-15 and 20-23 and in times of
        resting. The negative effect therefore wasn't catastrophic, but still very bad, but with a little twist. I
        suddenly got recommended videos on business, mindset, and responsibility. This “useless” content consumption
        therefore helped me, because, without it, I would have never learned that I had to fix my mind. Of course,
        reading would have been better, but where was this cognition supposed to stem from? I didn't know it was a
        problem in the first place. These videos made me pay attention to my mind for the first and 30-second lessons in
        short videos that get implanted into your mind if repeated often enough too. I should mention that the bad habit
        of YouTube consumption resolved itself later, by providing me a guide on how to. The most powerful lesson of
        these videos was radical responsibility.</p>

    <p>Radical responsibility is the key to a complete transformation because everything derives from it, thinking
        long-term, for example. Before I got introduced to the concept of radical responsibility I didn't care about my
        traumas, I thought at that time that they would resolve themselves, yet they never resolved themselves. After
        this, for around 8 months I let this maxim brew in my mind. I constantly took responsibility and recognized
        where the problems were located in the first place. This was the second step and this was also the 2nd longest.
        The longest step was the first one, which took 2.5 years of having no new traumas and something to occupy your
        mind with, which was work. </p>

    <p>But even if you occupy your mind with work or free it with meditation, it will be impossible to resolve every
        trauma completely. So, here is a short but powerful guide on how <em>it took 1 night to change everything</em>. I spoke
        through everything 3 times, which took 6 hours. I didn't actually speak, instead, I spoke in my mind with
        someone. Then I was done. The next day I woke up sick, with a fever. Then my soul felt free for the first time.
        It was April and 8 months had passed since August. I still wonder how recent this was and why it took so long,
        why I didn't do it earlier. </p>

    <p>It has to be a ritual to be suitable, it can even be an exceptionally long bath, walk, or text where you reflect
        on everything. Rituals in general, are exceptionally powerful and that's the reason they have always existed.
        For example, the change from childhood to adulthood transforms every life forever, as it transforms the roles of
        each individual fundamentally. Rituals for men entering adulthood shift the roles of females from providers,
        (mothers) to receivers (wives). Fundamental changes have to be marked by memorable events. Sometimes, these
        events are interesting per se, such as the German youth consecration, which most people often recall as
        memorable. Many rituals are also applicable in religious contexts, which means, God, the church, and
        spirituality will help too. </p>

    <p>However, radical responsibility is still the foundation, after it you will say things like: “I am no longer
        traumatized.” This works, because it returns control to your mind and a specific event to keep your mind
        accountable to. I would also recommend adding more of these events that catalyze responsibility, for example,
        getting rid (not just putting them away) of things that remind you of the negative past. “From now on, I am
        free, because my mind is. Now my life may start and blossom.” </p>

    <p>Having no traumas is one key to happiness, as your dark thoughts disappear. Your dark thoughts are the difference
        between reaching your goals and staying stuck because of your mind. If you fix it, you will become free
        mentally.</p>

    <p>I am convinced that this guide will help you and I wish you the best with your transformation. Even if the
        described method may not work for you, you will still make progress. Maybe read this text again in a few days
        and bookmark this guide, or print it out.</p>


    <ol>
        <p>Quick Overview</p>

        <li>Find traumas and don't try to judge yourself for them. Traumas are memories that cause stress or fear for
            a long time.</li>
        <li>Recognize that your mind needs to be fixed sooner or later, otherwise, you will miss out on a lot of life
            quality.</li>
        <li>Watch videos or read books on how to fix your mind from psychologists and other people.</li>
        <li>Take radical responsibility and control your mind. Say things like “I don't want to be traumatized”</li>
        <li>Repeat for a few months.</li>
        <li>The night where everything changes where you think through everything a bunch of times will come on its
            own, don't try to summon it. Other alternatives can be an extremely long bath, reflection in a notebook
            (must be on paper), or other rituals. </li>
        <li>Get rid of things reminding you of the past. From now on, your mind will have no reason to feel
            traumatized, as it will become easier to control it.</li>
        <li>Enjoy becoming free and keep making progress.</li>
        <li>Remember: Traumas do not make you stronger. Setting a building on fire doesn't make it stronger, even if
            it survived the fire.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>1. “Traumas make stronger”</p>

    <p>Some may see successful people who used to have many different heavy traumas and then ended up becoming
        successful. But they became successful because having the traumas and resolving them, this combination made them
        strong and not the individual parts. That means, a person who has not resolved their traumas won't become
        successful and a person with no traumas either, because there will be no need to “overcompensate” for the second
        person. </p>

    <p>Unresolved traumas are one of the worst experiences of the mind. It's the small things that make the difference
        and therefore, negative thoughts popping into the mind at random or while trying to fall asleep will steal
        immense amounts of live quality. There is no difference in material success if your mind still works against you
        in your most intimate moments. Remember the compound effect? Every negative thought adds up and so does every
        positive. That's why you need radical responsibility to take control of your mind, as your mind represents the
        only thing entirely inside your sphere of influence. - I know people who will try to deny this by saying “Your
        mind is just the product of your surroundings, external influences, and your subconscious” But this way of
        thinking won't bring them anywhere, as this violates the principle of radical responsibility. You can gain
        control of your mind entirely and question everything. It just takes long to get there. Eventually, your mind
        control will reach such levels that you will be able to do anything. That's why those successful people had
        traumas and became successful, they resolved them took control of their minds, and let their minds work toward
        them. People with traumas who never dealt with them never became successful, they never took responsibility and
        learned how to control their minds and let their minds work towards their goals. </p>

    <p>The most powerful book I have ever read was in 2022. I was called “Think and Grow Rich”. This book's main lesson
        is that you can get your subconscious mind to work towards your goals too, and that you can control your mind.
        Control of your mind enables you to control the minds of the collective too, that's called leadership or
        visionary. You simply have to start with yourself.</p>

    <p>2. “Overcompensation”</p>

    <p>I claimed people with no traumas will have no desire to reach massive levels of success. I think that happens for
        multiple reasons, the most important one being the concept of the <em>easy life</em>. Why should you try anything, if
        you already have everything? </p>

    <p>The concept of overcompensation refers to people doing too much to compensate for their past. It's tempting to
        argue for such a theory, although it's too simple. Here is what I can tell: no one chooses it. Once you see how
        bad your situation can get, you will try to make it never happen again, even if that requires overcompensation.
        Once you use the momentum to fix your traumas, why should you stop there and not continue to fix even more
        things? If you resolve your traumas, why should you stop halfway up with a lot of gained speed, once you are on
        an upward spiral already? </p>

    <p>3. “I would be a different person without my traumas”</p>

    <p>Without a doubt that's true, and you should still be grateful for anything that happens, this acceptance together
        with radical improvement will lead to happiness. Look forward (upright of course) and <em>Move on.</em></p>

    <p>Before you implement…</p>

    <p>I should mention 3 things. First of all, you have to perfect your life, or at least aim in that direction, for
        example, you will have to develop discipline, remove bad habits, start to do sports, eat healthily, sleep well…
        because then this method will work significantly better. Other things that help are walks and meditation daily.
    </p>

    <p>The second thing got lost between the lines. The power of this method comes from you doing everything on your own
        and how to do it on your own. There is limited value if you need another person to support you, because what if
        you get a new trauma then? It's better to learn on your own how to do it.</p>

    <p>The third thing you need to be aware of is your mind trying to work against you at this instant.</p>
    
    <p>I am praying for you ;-)</p>
