    <p>VR and AR are a thread</p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality" target="_blank">VR</a>
        stands for Virtual Reality, while
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality" target="_blank">AR</a>
        stands for Augmented Reality, one an alternative to the real world and the other one a perfect integration to
        the real world.
        This essay will focus mainly on AR, as this technology is much more potent.
    </p>

    <p>
        This essay is created on the occasion of the invention of VR
        55 years ago, my own experience with AR,
        and a leading company's announcement of their own AR headset.
    </p>

    <p>Before this essay gets downhill, here are the benefits of AR and VR:</p>

    <p><em>Higher engagement, comfort, intuitive experiences…</em></p>

    <p>Now, let's analyze the true problems of these new technologies. First of all, what problem does AR
        solve? Every business needs a problem to solve, for example, my apps solve the problem of
        calculator dependency caused by lowered mental math capabilities. The bigger the solved problem,
        the bigger the reward for your business. Bill Gates made computers available to the mainstream and
        became the richest person in the world. Visualize what kind of problems that solved. Slow
        communication, inconvenience, limited reach… These solved problems were gigantic and in
        accordance, his reward. Now, what problem does AR solve? The most obvious answer is that AR
        enables you to get rid of heavy hardware and provides a single solution for your personal computer,
        phone, or tablet - all in one. In that sense, it may be worth it. What problems does AR ACTUALLY
        solve? If you try looking it up on the internet, you will find some useless “use cases” like better
        visuals, applications in instructions, or better explanations. But these are not very big problems to
        solve, or not even desirable. </p>

    <p>Now you may be tempted to comment, that phones also don't solve any problems themselves.
        Radios exist, torches exist, cameras exist, telephones exist, and computers exist. The only thing that
        differs is the size and availability. This problem is fixed by an ordinary mobile phone. So, what
        problem does AR solve, that phones don't?</p>

    <p><em>More potent stimulation!</em></p>

    <p>I could end the essay right here, but let me explain in the next 1 000 words why more stimulation is
        going to end everything.</p>

    <p>Have you ever tried to read a book that was written more than 100 years ago or have you ever tried
        to watch a movie from 1960? Perhaps. As you noticed, it's decently hard to do that if you spend any
        minute of your life on the internet. You will find the movies from back then too boring to watch
        because they are lower resolution, and have fewer cuts, less music, less effect, and less stimulation.
        Because of the internet, especially social media, you will find that extremely hard.
    </p>

    <p>The internet started with websites, with text, some style, and nothing else. It had no animations, no
        colors, nothing. If the internet would have stopped here, we would have had all the benefits: search,
        email, digital libraries and it should have stopped right here. Then came a few websites that includes
        images and later videos. Decades later, even stimulating videos became too boring and in 2016
        TikTok was born. TikTok is used as a representation here because other social media is not much
        better. But like any social media, it is completely destructive in its very nature - because of its
        stimulation.</p>

    <p>Well, why is stimulation bad? Because stimulation paralyzes. It makes you unable to think properly,
        unable to just sit in the room and stare at the clock for as little as 15 minutes without any thoughts. It
        makes it impossible to be productive in any way. I am writing this essay in one sitting and I don't have
        a clock in my room, only sometimes I listen to music in the background. Because I never used things
        like TikTok, I find that doable. But I know that this is different for most people. If you have read so far
        into this text and did not look anywhere else, you have a decent attention span, contrary to most
        people, having an average screen time of 6 hours a day on their phone. I don't want to comment on
        how much of your youth, of your best years gets lost and how much talent, passion and experience
        some people sacrifice. 6 hours of screen time compounds. 6 hours is the equivalent of 50% of your
        waking hours! The time you spend on your phone is not only lost forever, like any other time you
        spend, it is wasted in a destructive manner. Instead of doing something for your health like sleeping,
        most people are, extremely is an understatement, sleep deprived. Instead of doing some sports,
        most people are laying in bed with a spine like a question mark. I think you understand why phone
        usage itself is bad and gets even worse if it gets more engaging, more stimulating, and more
        addictive </p>

    <p>Now, let's use this knowledge and transfer it to more stimulating AR, which is even more available
        than your phone because instead of it being in your pockets it's on your face. What is going to
        happen if you are no longer limited to turning off your phone, but need to use AR to live, because
        otherwise, you will feel stimulation deprived? Your life is going to get a lot worse if you start using AR
        instead of your phone because it has a new magnitude. </p>

    <p><em>Does anyone sincerely think that phones made their life better?</em></p>

    <p>Did your phone benefit in social situations, relationships, productivity, and navigation? No, most
        people don't even know how to use a map and compass anymore, without your phone, you are more
        productive and less distracted, and your “calendar-productivity-app” doesn't add any productivity,
        and phones made it significantly harder to socialize because people are just not as stimulating.

    </p>
    <p>These problems are going to be magnified with AR. </p>

    <p>Another problem of high stimulation is distraction, which REMOVES THE ABILITY TO THINK. What can
        you expect of the future if most people are going to lose the ability to think? Why should you take
        the effort to think, if you can distract yourself with some videos, if you try to think, you won't be able
        to because your stimulation baseline will be on another level. The future does not look bright if most
        people become pawns, too lazy and too stupid to think, all because of their own weakness amplified
        by AR, or does it? </p>

    <p>AR is going to amplify every problem of current society; it's going to rob you of your life and your
        ability to think. It's also going to remove any desire to change anything because of constant
        distractions </p>

    <p>Some people, mostly significant people or old people, don't use the internet at all, for one, because
        it's optional if you are important or old, but another reason to never use the internet is because of
        data collection. NOW PUT ON THAT STUPID AR-HEADSET ON YOUR FACE AND YOU WILL BECOME
        TRANSPARENT. Become transparent, lazy, stupid, distracted, unhappy, and lonely and the perfect
        foundation for a dark future is laid.</p>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

    <p>If you felt scared while reading this, good, let this text be a warning. The only way to gain control is to
        get informed about reality. Not every aspect of reality is great, especially not with technology past
        1990. But information is the only key to change, so pay attention. The only way to slow down these
        changes is to inform and resist these changes in every way possible. Don't ever allow anyone in your
        surroundings to use AR. If you are a landlord, forbid AR on your property. If you have some level of
        influence, inform others before it's too late!</p>
