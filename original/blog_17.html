    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Modern media is useless</span></h1>
    <h1>Stop watching news</h1>

    <p>Imagine turning on the television on a Monday evening to watch the news. The news starts with some fancy
        animations and music and is full of cuts, and dramatic stories, reduced to one minute and it hits you. You
        realize, that there was not a single thought, inside of the news - ever. News is entertainment disguised as
        information, there has never been a moment, where the news changed the course of your life or at least your day,
        instead, news, just like any media, simply distracts and entertains. Never has watching the news provided you
        with valuable information, so stop it, and you won't miss it. Instead, focus and what's valuable. </p>
