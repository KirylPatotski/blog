    <h1>No more social media</h1>

    <p>On this website, I constantly upload photos and blogs, on a massive scale, considering I'm on my own (so far...). Now, you
        may raise the question of why I don't upload my photos to social media anymore. Let's
        start with the least important reasons and elevate the fundamentality of the reasons as we progress through the
        text. </p>

        <p>"Social media" refers to a specific photo and lifestyle app.</p>

    <ol>

        <li>Fail</li>

        <p>I used to upload photos to social media, but this was before I started to take very good photos in the first
            place, that's why the photos I was posting were not as high quality and failed. As a consequence, I deleted
            my account, because I was getting no results. </p>

        <li>Oversaturation</li>

        <p>Maybe the photos also didn't reach anything because there were enough pictures already.</p>

        <li>Hostile algorithms</li>

        <p>Even though I uploaded it to social media, certain social media was never addictive to me, because I don't care about other
            people's “perfect lives”. That's a problem, because Instagram started to suspect me to be a bot around
            5 times, due to my disinterest in its platform. I don't want to use an app that does bring me anything
            except an awkward email. </p>

        <li>Soft pornography</li>

        <p>Because I know what kind of content performs the best on social media and what social media is known for in the
            first place, that is over-sexualized content, I don't believe social media to be elevating for its users. Since
            it conflicts with my moral compass, I would rather not use it. </p>

        <li>Hostile terms of service</li>

        <p>Social media claims your photos for itself, by uploading them, you give up all your rights - read the terms of
            service.<br><br>Maney social media's share data with 3rd parties. I don't know if you understand how catastrophic
            this is - your private photos are already on multiple servers which you have no control over. If you can't
            show your friends your photos, what are these photos doing on these databases?</p>

        <li>Waste of time</li>

        <p>Social media wastes time, even if you upload only. Even if it's only 5 minutes a day, 5 minutes a day adds up to
            31 hours per year, that's more than a whole day of your time that you gifted to a hostile platform. </p>

        <li>Dependence and no freedom</li>

        <p>I don't like being part of something hostile, and is a money-making machine, which takes away your freedom. I
            think the vision of a free internet is much more aligned with Western values then a censored and centralized
            one.</p>

        <li>There is nothing to get</li>

        <p>Let's suppose you started to make decent money on social media, which is more than unlikely. What then? Was the
            sacrifice of time, privacy, and freedom worth it?<br><br>I want to create photos for fun and not for
            performance. I have installed YouTube analytics blockers, because seeing that something performs not well,
            messes up your mental health, even if you have no control over it.</p>

        <li>Nothing to contribute</li>

        <p>If I upload my photos to my website, you will see them in context and not stripped away and reduced to pixels
            on a screen.
        </p>
    </ol>

    <p> This text is not about using social media, because you should never use it, there are no upsides to it, only
        instant gratification which destroys you. This text is about uploading to social media and why even that is a
        terrible idea.</p>
