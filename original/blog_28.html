    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Stay away from me</span></h1>

    <h1>My experiece with people</h1>

    <p>It's hard to start an essay that contains the knowledge of a whole life, even if it's a short one and seems to be
        destructive at first sight. But the best place to start is the beginning</p>

    <p>Why can modern art be considered <em>incomplete</em> and art created in the phase of the Renaissance not? Of
        course, there
        are many differences between the art created in this time and the art created today. Today, much more art is
        created than ever before, because it has become much easier to do so, universally that is a good thing. There
        are also much more forms of art that exist today, unimaginable in the 15th and 16th centuries. While music,
        architecture, sculptures, literature, and drawings have always existed, today we have many more: photography,
        AI, and cinema… with the difference, that the variety increased a lot in each area. Well, art is, and always has
        been, a representation of the current time. Of course, the variety is going to increase if more people start to
        create art, and of course, will technical advancements create new forms of art. But, because art is a
        representation of the artist's thoughts and life, and the society he/she lives in, it gives an insight into the
        people that live in it. </p>

    <p>David by Michelangelo is a prime example of uplifting and purposeful art. It tells you that you could be more
        than you are and that you need to keep learning, developing, and growing. That's because this statue is -
        complete. There is a lot of Renaissance art with an uplifting message, what does it say about society at the
        time? </p>

    <p>But now let's look at modern art. Most people consume more music than contemporary art, that's why we don't need
        to discuss it further. What, exactly, are modern songs about? Well, there are many songs with an uplifting
        message, but most of the songs talk about (or contain) degeneracy, narcissism, promiscuity, material wealth,
        rebellion, drugs, suicide, and negativity. (I am not a conservative granddad, I'm 16 btw.) How are you supposed
        to have a prospering society, if its core is rotting from within? </p>

    <p>It's the leaders whom people take examples from. If the leaders of the 15th and 16th centuries started to educate
        themselves, soon people from the lower societal rank started to follow. But, if our modern role models are
        promiscuous narcissists, what will it do with society as a whole? Now I have already explained this decline,
        using the example of art. </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This text is titled “Stay away from me”, this title is not random, and you'll see why. Every human is unique, art
        also shows that, and everyone has different experiences. But everyone knows that being an untrustworthy loser is
        undesirable. </p>

    <p>I would say, there are generally 4 types of people: upright, respectable, idiots, and losers, ranked from the
        best to the worst. Surprisingly, this is independent of age and income and any other metric, but they dictate
        both things: if one is upright his/her whole life, he/she will become rich, with a high chance.</p>

    <p><u>The upright (in my experience 3%)</u></p>

    <p>Even though the upright may have bad starting conditions, he/she still tries to be the absolute best at
        everything and sets new standards everywhere, once gaining enough knowledge. The upright understands the
        principle of complete, radical accountability. If one breaks his leg, one doesn't complain but rather says: “I
        should have paid more attention” The upright live by self-set rules, which are absolute for him/her. They easily
        resist anything and are quick to recover. The upright are always upright, honest, trustworthy, and authentic.
        That means some people don't like them, but that's ok because they are so polarizing, that everyone has an
        opinion about them. That's why many admire them or hate them, nothing in between. The upright are the ones
        contributing the most to society because they serve as role models. </p>

    <p>I think, now you have understood, that the upright is almost complete, just like Michelangelo's statue. But any
        loser will say, that Michelangelo's statue is boring. There is a simple way to find these people if you yourself
        are authentic. </p>

    <p><u>Respectable (in my experience 27%)</u></p>

    <p>Respectable people make up a quarter of people. The respectable are a step further away from completeness than
        the upright but are still decent. They are no losers or idiots, since they still improve themselves, even if
        they don't see much success. They can become upright if a bit of time passes or they fix some flaws, like a lack
        of focus in order to accelerate. Maybe they are simply not gifted, but they still try to be the best version of
        themselves. </p>

    <p><u>Idiot (in my experience 10%)</u></p>

    <p>Idiots are losers but are still above them because they have some better character traits. Idiots are at the
        bottom of society and don't see the point in improving themselves, they simply accept that “not everyone can be
        successful”. They can still be friendly, but this friendliness can't hide the fact they are a shell of what they
        could be. </p>

    <p><u>Loser (in my experience 60%)</u></p>

    <p>Losers make up the majority of people. They never did anything heroic, remarkable, meaningful, or interesting.
    </p>

    <p>Life is extremely giving. Let's say one was a loser in primary school. One still has the chance to better
        themselves in the gymnasium. If one is still a loser, one can still make the Abitur (German school diploma) even
        after one has left school. If one is still a loser, one still has the chance to get a higher education for free
        in Germany. </p>

    <p>But still, losers fail at everything they do or simply don't achieve anything remarkable. They constantly
        complain, are ungrateful, and blame others rather than taking radical responsibility. Worst of all, they drag
        down others and the people threatening their excuses. </p>

    <p>It's easy to become a loser, and hard to be upright. Losers are so weak, that they don't even try. Losers pick
        the wrong environment. They simply fail at everything and have still expectations, but most of them don't even
        try. Losers can't resist pleasure. They don't consume uplifting art but rather degenerate. That's why art is
        made for them, which could be considered poisonous. They make up the biggest market.</p>

    <p>...</p>


    <p>None of the destinations are fixed, because people can change. There are events providing 180° turns. As you are
        reading this, there are certain people in your mind at the bottom. Stop talking to them! Talk to people that are
        uplifting, which will provide your life with value. Don't waste your time trying to lift up losers. </p>

    <p>You may feel the moral obligation to help losers, especially if you have known them for a long time. But losers
        don't want to be helped. There is also something disgusting and narcissistic about helping people that don't
        want your help. You are positioning yourself as the hero and lifting yourself up, regardless of whether you are
        doing it intentionally or subconsciously. You will feel great after trying to help a loser. Let me put it this
        way. Being in prison is an unpleasant situation, do you feel obligated to help a prisoner? No, why not? Because
        the prisoner is responsible for his own situation. Why do you assume that the loser is innocent and not
        responsible himself? It's easy to think that the environment and certain events in life play a crucial role.
        They do, but you are still in control. You choose your environment and you certainly have an impact on your own
        life. Just because losers blame others, doesn't mean it's not their own fault. Why do you think, the age of
        criminal responsibility is, in most countries, 12 years? Only spend time with people who want to elevate you,
        and consume content that elevates you.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Before December 2022 I did not talk to anyone. That is for a couple of reasons. </p>

    <p>First of all. What does need to happen in order for you to stop talking? What do you think am I implying with
        these 2 questions? I didn't have it easy, from 2012 - 2019.</p>

    <p>In the end of 2020, I was 13 years old and started to learn how to code. I had nothing to show, I was stupid and
        incompetent. That's why I focused purely on my own path. Only in December 2022, I started to get more free time
        because I gained knowledge and expertise at that time and could work better with less time. Only at that point I
        even considered becoming social - so to speak. But it would take until April 2023 to resolve everything
        mentioned in the previous paragraph, because I took radical responsibility. I remember this night in April 2023
        when I imagined telling someone everything, I laid in bed until 1:00 awake. As a result, I got sick, a high
        fever for a couple of days. </p>

    <p>Another reason that stopped me is that I was an asshole, in 2019 something negative happened that removed this
        trait forever, marking a new chapter.</p>

    <p>My interests also played a role. When I was 7, I started to get interested in nuclear energy, quantum physics.
        The universe was my previous interest - so to speak. It's hard to find people with a shared interest in nuclear
        energy. Now I partially have the same problem…, although my interests shifted. </p>


    <p>One thing I observed to be true is that your environment matters. I said at the beginning, only to surround
        yourself with uplifting people. Let me tell you a story. In April 2023 I got advice from a uni professor to
        create polls, related to my apps. The first poll I created was in May. I asked it 5 people. The second round got
        asked to 25, I knew now what questions to ask. There were 3 replies of absolute value. Then, (as my third blog
        suggests) I gained a new insight in May. I used my expertise, asking the right people the right questions, and
        created a third poll. I gave it to ~ 8 people. There was only 1 person who gave the poll back the next day. Some
        people didn't give it back at all. How can you be living that way, not being able to return a 5-minute poll if
        asked to? (I am grateful for the people that did return it ;-)) </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few days ago, I wrote a text about photo management because chances are, you have too many photos. But, there I
        something so obvious about this text, that I have missed. I wanted to make this text feel bitter-sweet because I
        lived under the assumption, that some people have too many good photos and can't deal with them. But, as I
        reflected upon it, I noticed that my assumption is mostly applicable to sophisticated readers, like you. The
        bottom 70% don't read my texts, but they have the biggest problems. Their galleries are not only cluttered with
        bad photos, duplicates, and screenshots (whenever the hell that's emotionally valuable) but also illegal and
        explicit content. That means you do one thing just as any other. That's not per-se bad, but it has a problem. If
        someone hasn't taken a 180° turn and did bad things, he is still at high risk. </p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>How do know whether someone is trustworthy?</p>

    <p>After reading my thoughts, and experiences as well as my argumentations, am I more or less trustworthy than an
        inauthentic person? </p>

    <p>(The person may still read this, so I have to twist the description a little bit). There is a person I know from
        school. He is a power-hungry collection of bad habits, trying to drag me down, and worst of all - inauthentic. I
        don't like a lot of people and a lot of people don't like me, but that's ok because not everyone can and should
        everyone. Most people are authentic enough for you to know if they are any good, assuming that you are not
        naïve. But this person is a complete shell - says things exactly like the government narrative. If you don't
        have an opinion about politics, all right. But if your opinion matches the government's narrative, without any
        of your own thoughts, I can't trust you. I can only trust people I know something authentic about. Some people
        won't tell you their secrets, obviously, and they don't have to, because you can still see when someone is
        constrained in his own thought or constrains others.</p>

    <p>If there are people trying to influence your speech, “That's not funny!”, “That's so racist…”, “That's so [word
        used too often so that it lost its meaning] or your thoughts, stay away from them. There is a difference between
        censorship of thoughts and words and education because education influences your thoughts positively.</p>

    <p>Next to authenticity (lying is inauthentic too), there is another related trait that makes a person
        (un)trustworthy. That is my ladies and gentlemen, the ability to think clearly, unconstrained, and logically. AR
        technology is against everyone's interest because it will make you weaker, more docile, and remove your ability
        to think. How can someone argue for AR then, what kind of idiot wants to make their life worse on purpose? How
        can someone be trusted who is against themselves, a loser so to speak? </p>

    <p>Another type of untrustworthy trait revolves around weakness. If you are a pushover or a collection of bad
        habits, <em>stay away from me</em>. How can I trust you, if you don't trust yourself?</p>

    <p>The way you figure everything out is by being authentic, trustworthy, and strong towards others. If you are
        authentic, you will see who people really are.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Why “no” is the most powerful word and “I have had enough” is the most powerful phrase.</p>

    <p>In Spain, where I was in 2023 for half a month, I got to know a kid, 19, who was the most submissive person I
        have ever seen. I could tell him anything and he would say “Yeah, you are correct” and would be too weak to
        stand up for himself, meaning, inauthentic. </p>

    <p>In 6th grade, we went on a school trip. I brought the game “Catan”. (Yes, board games did exist back then too,
        not just mobile phones) The game Catan is a game, where you have 2 dice and a map with recourses on it. There
        are numbers from 2-12 on each field with recourses. If anyone throws a dice and their sum equals the field's
        number, you get the according recourses. Obviously, the 2 and 12 are rare, the best numbers are around 7 because
        they have the most combinations with 2 dice. Well, we played this game, and even if he was the first to build an
        initial village, he picked the worst options. He is no threat to anyone. He is irrelevant. </p>

    <p>Well, how to gain respect? Some people offered me, what I would describe as moral decay. I said no once. If you
        say no and then nothing else, people will stop treating you as a pushover. People won't treat you as a pushover
        if you sit and stand _upright_, that's the reason it's called this way. You can prevent your decline simply by
        saying no. You are the product of the people you spend your time with, say no to people that you know don't want
        the best for you. It's better to be alone than to talk to the wrong kind of people. Learn this now or learn it
        the hardest way yourself. Ask people for advice, if you are still unsure.</p>

    <p>You can say “no” to totalitarianism, abuse, fear, doubt, to criticism, … </p>

    <p>If you do say no, make it final and immutable (unless you were wrong). That's what making a decision means. It
        means removing any alternatives and focusing. </p>

    <p>“I have had enough” is the most powerful phrase. There were so many moments where I said this and changed my life
        forever. In August 2022 I wasn't able to do 10 pushups. I have had enough and did 100 per day until I started
        going to the gym. In July 2023 I have had enough of stuttering. Now I don't stutter anymore. “I have had enough”
        can revert so much time, if you were wrong, and “I have had enough” can start fundamental change.</p>

    <p>In 1215 people had enough of tyranny and decided to limit the God-like character of kings with the document
        called magna carta. It was a single document that laid the foundation for modern civilization. All historical
        changes occurred through “I have had enough”. The French had enough of totalitarianism and decided in 1789 to
        start a revolution. </p>

    <p>All companies solve (or create and then solve) a problem that people have enough of, or these companies are
        insignificant.</p>

    <p>A person who always helps is no threat to anyone, a person who can't say no is not a threat either. If you treat
        yourself like a weakling, people will treat you as a weakling. That will bring you into a downward spiral. That
        also means that you can make people think you aren't a loser. Stand upright!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Look at any crowd (even if that's of a concert of modern music). Everyone has their own story to tell, everyone
        carries a piece of information only they know of. Everyone has specific traits and a specific skill set. That's
        beautiful.</p>

    <p>How can it be, that if I meet new people, most of them don't even ask what I do for a living?</p>

    <p>That's, I guess, typical loser behavior. How can some people go through life with closed eyes, not even aware of
        what kind of things some people may know? A single conversation can change your life forever, and they aren't
        even interested. This is not unique to either, many people know what I'm talking about right now. You have to
        assume; this person knows something you don't know and have never known or even heard before.</p>

    <p>Many people try to network because they understand this problem and theirs, they try to overcome their
        incompleteness by finding talent. There are several big problems with networking. First of all, networks are
        social connections and they have to be fair. Don't expect that a successful person will spend time with you.
        Don't expect that every person will give you something without you returning something. Also, networking can
        sometimes be action-faking. Reach a certain level of success before you start networking. Whenever you are
        ready, networking will help you significantly. </p>

    <p>...</p>


    <p>Bring your house in perfect order before you criticize the world</p>

    <p>If I was a pushover, dishonest, full of bad habits, inauthentic, constrained, lazy, or morally decayed, I would
        not dare to write such a text. I know this piece of wisdom from Jordan Peterson's book “12 Rules for Life”. My
        life does look perfect and I live by every principle I listed - that's where they come from. That's also the
        problem with “political correctness”, (which is a form of constrained thought and therefore inauthentic). People
        who say “climate change is bad”, propagate Western degeneracy, or blandly state “abuse is bad” elevate
        themselves above these issues. I dare every one of these people to publish their diaries, because if they can't
        control their own life, how are they supposed to handle the responsibilities of entire countries?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>I could give you more tips, but perhaps, it's necessary for me to wait a little bit more, to get even more
        experience. </p>

    <p>Don't spend time with people that don't want the best for you.</p>
