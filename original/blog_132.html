    <h1>Developing warmth</h1>

    <p>You may think that telling people they can improve by taking responsibility for their lives and that every flaw
        can be turned into a strength is kind. I must admit, this is a very shallow view of warmth. - I can tell that
        after trying to develop warmth for months on end. Let me explain. It's this very subtle realization and you must
        find it yourself. For example, when a skyscraper gets built, I'm amazed at how civilization is kept together.
        Aren't you amazed too? Everything works together from the design, planning, recourses, transport, financing, and
        construction. It gets even more breathtaking when one realizes that there is no one truly steering the ship of
        the world, no one knows what will happen tomorrow except for God, but he also might change his mind. Anything
        could happen tomorrow, and if there is something that brought us forward through every adversary, it's kindness.
        If one gets lost at the high sea between the waves, and someone notices, almost half an army gets mobilized to
        save someone who doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Even if redemption seems distant, and the
        problem prevalent, if one is lost in a sea of danger, one can be sure that if someone gets wind of it, the
        saving sails will be set, regardless of whether it is difficult or whose fault it is. Call it duty, call it
        compassion, or call it love. God didn't abandon the earth either, just because humans a flawed. If there is one
        thing that brought humans through every adversary that ever existed and will ever exist, it is kindness.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Not so fast.</strong></em> This is about developing warmth, not about being the most
        loving person on earth. Realizing that everything is held together by love took months. Warmth is also not as
        straightforward as you might think, to every moment one wants to surrender in compassion, there's a trap
        lurking, and in many cases, warmth is inappropriate. Before I arrived at this conclusion, I had to win an inner
        fight, and the opponents were strong. So strong in fact, that the fight took long, however in the end, love won.
        And because the opponent is incredibly strong, you have to get to know it. It has a name too, it is the
        rationale. It thinks and does not feel, it is without a heart. The rational brought humans forward, just as it
        will bring the individual forward. However, a certain point will be reached when the rationale ends. Only then
        will it be clear why love still won, step by step.</p>

    <h1>Stage 1. Everyone is responsible for their life anyway.</h1>

    <p><em><strong>I have zero empathy.</strong></em> Call me whatever you want. Why should I care about a stranger's
        self-inflicted suffering? Why should you care? Everyone has problems and everyone is responsible for his own
        life. Why should you pity anyone? The way forward in life is to take full responsibility for it, if someone is
        too weak to do so, they must be left behind. Even if destiny strikes with something outside of your sphere of
        influence, the way to respond is yours even more. If it starts to rain, you could have brought an umbrella. You
        are responsible for everything that happens, regardless of whether it was your fault. </p>

    <h1>Stage 2. Pity only to those who need it, not to those who act weak.</h1>

    <p><em><strong>Petty complains.</strong></em> Even if one's complaints were a hundred percent objective, their
        impact is zero. You can forget about sympathy. The world is built on doing, not on complaining. I can't think of
        a single situation where one benefits from listening. The only people who profit from speaking complaints are
        demons who want to suck the warmth out of everyone else. Let me put it this way. Listening to complaints can
        make you a millionaire if you intend to solve the problem, but not if someone complains that it's breathtakingly
        exhausting to move up three stories. There is zero you can do if someone complains about being sad for no
        obvious reason other than total depravity of purpose. It's pointless to hear complaints about inflation. Yes,
        inflation is bad for ninety-nine percent of people, but what have you done to profit from it? The exam was hard?
        Let me tell you, if you actually did something for it and gave your best, you would be proud, regardless of the
        outcome. Every time someone complains, they are pointing to a problem, regardless of how trivial it is. However,
        if they refuse to fix it and it never occurred to them that problems are fixable, never speak to them again.</p>

    <p><em><strong>You deserve no pity, save it for those who need it.</strong></em> You can give some sympathy to the
        one who lost his legs, it doesn't matter whose fault it was. However, being young, safe, healthy, and living in
        overall great life conditions, you deserve no one's pity. From a cultural-philosophical perspective, boys become
        men the second they take full responsibility for their lives. If everything is your fault, then where is the
        sympathy? I couldn't care less about anyone's struggle if it's self-inflicted, and my indifference turns into
        disgust if the person struggling is a spoiled brat. I doubt you disagree; do you sincerely care if a random
        spoiled girl says that her lipstick has the wrong tone of red? Showing sympathy for someone who has never
        struggled is evil. It seems the only reason one would do that is to gain attention, validation or just to
        elevate their self-perception. Giving sympathy to those who don't deserve it is plain evil.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Most people I know people have never struggled.</strong></em> I wrote in one of my texts that every
        man has a similar life. Firstly, they are born, grow a bit up, are a complete loser in every realm of life, then
        fall in love with a random girl who rejects them, their heart gets broken, they stop being a loser and maybe
        it's so painful that they decide that they want but success in life to make sure it never happens again. As it
        turns out, one in five people has never gotten their heart broken. From those who did, most went perhaps through
        two weeks of sadness and then thought, 'Whatever, I don't care too much anymore'. A broken heart made me suffer
        for approximately a year. Yet, that's nothing in comparison to what billions of people went through or are going
        through. One billion people live on less than a dollar a day. Last year, a war started in Sudan and no one even
        cared. There are thousands of people or even children who got their entire family killed by a bomb and they
        still have to get up every day and make ends meet. Every time I think of my problems, I remember that I have
        none. Heartbreak? Remember the kid who lost his parents in war and is now completely alone and still gets up
        every day? Your problems, my problems, your friends' problems, … they are completely pathetic.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Warmth is, it seems, often an excuse.</strong></em> If you want to win, you need to be hard on
        yourself. Period. Sympathy is for peasants. Warmth will not drive you to success, only the depravity thereof.
        Let me tell you a story. There was a nineteen-year-old classmate I used to be friends with. He is the antidote
        to me when it comes to sympathy. He is Christian and is abundant in friends, he is understanding, tolerant, and
        compassionate. On the question of whether life is better as a bourgeois or a peasant, he responded with the
        latter. I would even tell my sister that he should take him because he's decent. Anyway, with all of his
        compassion, sympathy, and empathy, what do you think happened when he wanted to free himself from his digital
        addiction? We called each other for around seventy days in a row and I gave him tips and held him accountable.
        Do you think, he who is warm to himself and everyone else was able to break free? You can only accomplish or
        attempt what is hard by being even harder, not by being a pillow, soft and warm. I do not mean to offend him,
        yet still, such is the nature of warmness, it is at high risk to turn into tolerance, weakness, and excuses.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Chances are, I've been there myself and fixed it.</strong></em> If someone struggles with something
        and I've been through it, my compassion doesn't increase, it decreases. Struggling with social media addiction?
        Well, I've been there and broke free. I shared my experience; I knew exactly how such a person is thinking and
        why it is difficult. Still, I overcame every obstacle and those who fail, don't try hard enough. It's as simple
        as that. I went from an 8-hour screen time, nothing to do, childhood trauma, no friends, and no support from
        anyone to just 15 minutes. If you can't do it despite getting help from everyone, try harder or accept defeat
        and live an unexceptional life in moderation. Social media addiction is just one example. I used to eat sugar as
        well. I got my heart broken too. I healed from my traumas without any help. It's all doable, everything else is
        <em>irrational.</em></p>

    <p><em><strong>I specifically avoid getting pity.</strong></em> Everyone felt that there was something very wrong
        about me, until a year ago. One thing that made me so strange is that I had many mental scars, traumas for
        short. I didn't want anyone's pity by talking about my traumas, I just moved on and wrote five months later how
        I did that. Before writing that text, my grandmother who I'm very close didn't even know I had traumas.
        Likewise, four months passed between my getting my heart broken and my writing about it. Contrary to popular
        belief, I knew that opening up and digging into your wounds makes them not heal. I don't get the hypocrisy, if
        you break your arm, you put it in a plaster and let it rest, you don't massage cuts and neither do you remove
        the plaster to do pushups. Knowing that opening up is as nonsensical as doing pushups with a broken arm, I still
        opened up to my friends and to my blog on that girl who rejected me and how much it hurt. What do you think the
        price of sweet, encouraging words was? </p>

    <p><em><strong>Be willing to pay the price. </strong></em> I don't know, maybe for some, it's indeed better to open
        up. After all, if your arm healed enough, you may start to do pushups again. Just make sure to be willing the
        price. When I burned out after working 14-hour days for two and a half years straight, I didn't complain, I
        didn't want anyone's pity. I knew it was my fault. If I wanted to avoid it, I should have never started pursuing
        business. I paid the price, ten days of nothing and a few handicapped weeks. When someone who does nothing else
        than sports damages his knees, he pays the price for his sports. But if this person complains, trying to get
        some pity, he is detached from reality. Always, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price of corn and
        invert sugar syrup, whatever that name even means, is obesity. The price of sports can be a damaged body. The
        price of being authentic can be isolation. If you don't agree to pay the price, don't do it. If you didn't
        expect to pay a price, learn. If you agreed to pay the price, paid it, and started to suffer, only then may you
        deserve sympathy. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Warmness is no virtue if you don't have control.</strong></em> Of course, war is evil and everyone is
        anti-war, yet nothing changes if you complain about it. No matter how much you can relate to the civilians'
        misery, nothing changes, you may as well not care. In this context, empathy in that sense is mere virtue
        signaling. The first lesson of stoicism is not to think of things you can't change anyway. Only if you are
        willing to do something and know that what you do has an impact, may you feel pity, but then you must do
        something. </p>

    <h1>Stage 3. I believe, a flaw is not something to pity and everything can be turned into a strength.</h1>

    <p><em><strong>The magic of compensation.</strong></em> My life consists of pretty much failures only. I write, no
        one reads, I speak, no one listens, I create and no one uses. Failed apps, flopping videos, and insignificant
        texts are all that there is. Next to objectively failing at pretty much everything I attempt; I have many flaws.
        But that's ok, because I try hard to compensate. </p>

    <p>A large ego is objectively a flaw. Arrogant people are usually irrelevant, especially if they age. If they don't
        get humble, no one wants to spend time with them and their ego daggers them from within. Furthermore, many
        egocentric people think that they can stop learning or even stop putting in the work because they are special,
        entitled, or 'misunderstood'. Consequently, their ego makes them unpleasant to be around, and fail at everything
        since they are too smart to try. Due to the nature of ego, many realize only too late the wrong path they were
        on. Hence, ego brings a lot of problems for most and it's better to remove that flaw. - Yet, I have a very large
        ego and somehow, I don't rot from within. How so? Well, it did cause a lot of pain to figure out how to use it.
        Now I understand, that I need to earn thinking highly of myself - that's called humility. I understand, that if
        I want to feel like the alpha, which I want because of my ego, I need to do what it takes. Doing what it takes
        means accepting that one is, a nobody, and needs to put in the effort. In that sense, humility is the process of
        justifying ego. And that's true. The more my ego grows, the humbler and loving I get. The moments I move forward
        the most are the ones where I'm the kindest. The only reason I'm developing myself is because of my ego. If I
        were a peasant, all loving, humble, and balanced, I wouldn't need to write a text where I transform myself.
        Neither would I need to get up in the middle of the night and neither would I need to go to the gym. Anything
        that doesn't have an ego is dead, the leaf blown by the wind, a snowflake falling in silence, or a river finding
        its way without resistance. Anything that strives does it because of ego, even if said ego is abstract. We went
        from ego making one unpleasant to be around to the only reason one should grow as a person. </p>

    <p>I believe, that everyone can take their flaws or handicaps and turn them into greatness. Should you pity a person
        in a wheelchair? Well, there's Stephen Hawking who will be remembered forever. I believe that it's exactly being
        trapped in the body that gave him the freedom to become a legendary thinker. </p>

    <h1>Stage 4. Regardless of the rationale, one needs to be a human.</h1>

    <p><em><strong>I realized something…</strong></em> Normally I have an easy time ignoring things. As you may know, I
        create videos on self-improvement. Naturally, there are useless mean comments. For some reason, it started to
        bother me. After it stayed in my mind for long enough, I realized that it was because I lacked love. If I had it
        all, I wouldn't care about a content-free comment. I also realized that cold and harsh comments don't bring
        anyone forward. It's pointless to be cold towards others. Sure, I still don't care about strangers too much,
        everyone has absolute responsibility over his life, and so on, but that's unproductive when it comes to dealing
        with others. </p>

    <p><em>“Here comes another twist. Why try hard to be proud of oneself? For love as well, nothing more, nothing less.
            Either out of love, to others, to God, or even to oneself, or to gain love.” - text #131</em></p>

    <p><em><strong>Be warmest to the closest.</strong></em> Despite my realization that warmth is necessary to deal with
        others, I know that I need to keep that moderation. No matter how abundant of love I was, I still wouldn't care
        too much about a random stranger's suffering. Empathy should primarily be kept in the inner circle. If someone
        close to me was to cry, I wouldn't think ‘You're useless and a complete loser', instead, I would cheer them up.
        Rarely do I care about strangers. Why should I? </p>

    <p><em><strong>But then, what about strangers?</strong></em> I wanted to tell you a story, but I struggle to because
        this is not a step-by-step tutorial but rather an intuition. I see, how everyone has their place in the
        universe. If someone grew up with slow parents, got fed doughnuts, was told he needs to rest otherwise he will
        work himself to death, got a gaming console for Christmas, and has no discipline at all, he is set to become a
        loser by all means. School is boring, which of course no human in the last three thousand years ever noticed,
        and since they didn't get told at home that school doesn't matter anyway, they misbehave and get subtly mocked
        by everyone, especially the teachers until they become the living representation of a failure. There's such a
        failure in my grade and when he got subtly used as a bad example by a teacher. It hit me, that everyone has
        their place in the universe. He has bad luck, and that bad luck is compounded from the very start and now it's
        perhaps too late. I'm doubtlessly ahead of the crowd, but most of it is due to a very rare combination of
        circumstances. If I was just slightly less intelligent, slightly less supported by my parents, or slightly less
        desperate, I would not have been able to leap in life. He is still responsible for his life, nevertheless,
        merely catching up he would need quite a lot. To surpass everyone, he would need to do the impossible twice.
        Every principle I write remains true, for example, radical responsibility, discipline, sacrifice …, but doing
        the impossible twice is, let's say, difficult. Everyone has their place in the universe. Everyone is stuck, I
        must accept that and be warm, because by a hair, that could have been you or me. </p>

    <p><em>“There are only a few moments where I care about a stranger's suffering. However, there's a guy I have known
            since early childhood and he has nonexistent self-esteem. I haven't spoken to him in years, yet sometimes I
            see him and he, it appears stagnates in life. I know that he didn't have it easy and I think to myself, may
            God bless him. But still, the responsibility is his, and the choice is his as well. I indeed feel nothing
            for the person that I don't know who wastes his life and shows weakness, more so if I've been through it
            myself, but man, … I understand that sometimes bad things happen not because - but just.” - text #131 </em>
    </p>

    <p>It looks like the cold rationale held strong. In the end, the heart won still, even if just by a bit.</p>
