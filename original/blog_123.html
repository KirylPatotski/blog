    <h1>Complacency</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Notes from Sunday, 17.3.2024.</em></strong> Walked around 32 km today, approximately 6 hours. The
        weather was perfect, it was sunny and the temperature was just right. After having walked for 4 hours, I stopped
        to eat an ice cream and enjoyed it, without my conscience thrashing me for being undisciplined. Instead, I ate
        the ice cream as if I were a normal 16-year-old. Something unbelievable a few months ago. Tomorrow I will spend
        my day in Dresden.</p>

    <h1>1. Fries are tasty</h1>

    <p>A couple of days ago, I drove, via driving school, to a town around one hour away from where I live. It was sunny
        and the open roof of the car let in mildly warm air. The sun stood low, giving a golden scent to the atmosphere.
        The villages we drove through were quiet, sleepy, and relaxed. How pretty villages are! The rivers had a
        saturated dark blue as they reflected the late afternoon sky. While driving it's not silent either, you are
        listening to music from the radio to become energized. How great it feels to be twenty times faster than
        walking, and that effortlessly too! Eventually, we arrived, and the driving teacher and I took a break at a
        parking lot while ordering some coffee for him and some fries for me. Not having eaten American fast food since
        '19, the taste made me reminiscent of my childhood, when we ate American fries in Belarus. We stood outside of
        the bistro and I felt happy. Music, speed, no pressure, warm weather, birds singing, golden light, and
        magnificent villages. Everything was just so relaxed. This feeling of freedom! Standing in that parking lot and
        being melancholic would have been impossible, especially if one was together with energetic and humorous
        friends. </p>

    <p>I did not have a voice annoying me about the shallowness of the pleasure I found fulfilling. I simply enjoyed the
        moment like an ordinary person and was fully present on this Friday afternoon. But I would not be me if I didn't
        turn this experience into a 15,000-word text capable of transforming lives. If I deeply enjoy such a moment,
        given that I'm driven and young, what the hell do I need riches and success for? What try hard for, if, in the
        end, I end up liking the shallower forms of existence? I can go for walks without being successful. I can look
        at the sun without a million in the bank. I can play with my future children without living in a chateau. I can
        wonder about the essence of life without a six-pack. I do not need to be successful to do the things I enjoy
        doing anyway. Ironically, getting successful could rob me of the things I enjoy, under too much pressure, there
        may be no time left to go for walks. </p>

    <p>For years I worked hard to reach my authentic ideal life, and now I have reached it, finally, how great! - If
        life was only that simple… Reaching your ideal life makes you stagnate; when you get happy with your life, there
        is no reason to get out of bed, which is one of the worst feelings one can have. If reaching one's ideal life
        creates misery, it raises the question what makes you think you know what you truly want? This is a journey to
        discover what one shall get out of bed for if one is happy with one's life.</p>

    <h1>2. Desperation so large it's my entire story</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Bad start.</em></strong> When I was 13, at the end of '20, I started to think to myself: I have
        nothing, except for some scars. I was deeply dissatisfied with my life for as long as I can remember. I wanted
        to get more out of it. I didn't want to live the average life under any circumstances. I wanted to live a deep
        and mindful one, I didn't want to peak at a party… Since December '20, when I was 13 years old, I started to
        grip my life. I had amassed dissatisfaction to the point that it was unbelievable. I wanted to distance myself
        from all of the nonsense that happened in the past eight years. I couldn't imagine myself living an ordinary
        life. - This dissatisfaction gave me energy and purpose.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Growing consciousness.</em></strong> When 13, I started to be conscious. Most people say they gained
        consciousness at 3,4 or 5 years old, but this transformation as a 13-year-old was just as steep. (At 16 I was
        able to grow my consciousness large enough to be able to turn off the thinking mind at will, so this
        transformation was just as steep). Consciousness at high enough levels renders one incapable of living the
        ordinary life, you stop being a fish in a school and become an eagle - this makes the average life even more
        painful. Your dominating force ceases to be peer pressure and the desire for the unknown becomes its substitute.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>I hated my life.</em></strong> I was not only very dissatisfied as a 13-year-old but I was also
        annoyed by no one listening to me because I was at the bottom of the social hierarchy, no matter how correct I
        may have been. I was annoyed that I was asocial, mostly it was my fault. I grew resentful of my life for having
        given me multiple traumas to fight with simultaneously. I was pissed that I wasted years of my youth doing
        nothing and spending time on the internet simply because I had nothing to do and couldn't get myself interested
        in reading. I resented my mother for being overly protective. I found my room ugly, full of things I only liked
        because my parents thought I was interested in looking at cars that couldn't move. My body was weak, and after
        the holidays I always got a side stitch while warming up in the gym class. I had a body incapable of anything. I
        was annoyed by being stupid and without any useful skills. I was angry for having no money. The smallest problem
        at that time was that I didn't have a hot blonde girl, instead, I had my own problems in abundance. I had
        nothing except the damage I collected over the last years and deep dissatisfaction. </p>

    <p><strong><em>The perfect conditions to push super hard.</em></strong> What differed me from the rest, I may have
        been a damaged 13-year-old, but I wasn't a stupid or lazy one, quite the contrary. I was so bright that I was
        able to outshine every other classmate and even skip 9th grade effortlessly by going from 8th to 10th grade.
        However, this only brought me a superiority complex, it made me arrogant and intolerant. Because I was damaged,
        smart, full of resentment, and felt superior at the same time, it was the perfect combination of things to grip
        my life and push it to its limits. Traumas haunt you in your most intimate moments, right before you fall
        asleep, they come knocking on the door. If they knock hard enough, you let them in without your will. Great, now
        you have some motivation right before you fall asleep. Intelligence enables fast learning and enables frequent
        course adjustment. Resentment is a force. Resentment is the force that makes you able to contradict your will,
        i.e. to resist temptations no matter how large. A superiority complex makes you ignore typical constraints and
        limits, such as the one that goes something along the lines of 'you need to eat sweets, otherwise, you will have
        a massive burnout.' Also, that you must not forget, in '20 and early '21, there was no school because of the
        Coronavirus. I had the perfect conditions to work super hard. </p>

    <p><strong><em>I started to work hard.</em></strong> So, it will not surprise you that for the first few months,
        from December '20 to spring '21 I started to learn how to program (as a 16-year-old, I don't have enough mental
        damage to do so and dislike programming) and I did for 8-14 hours a day. It was interrupted by a few months of
        me taking a break, I started to study Chinese for two hours daily. In the summer of '21, I decided to start a
        YouTube channel, which I wanted to do for quite some time already. I started with computer videos, shifted to
        cooking videos, and then to documentary-style videos, but then abandoned it all for various reasons, mainly
        because it didn't work and started to create time-lapses. The time lapses were at least fun to create and edit.
        The summer of '21 was the time when my Android Development course started and also when 10th grade did, as I
        went from 8th grade to 10th directly. It was hard. The programming course occupied me for 12 hours per week and
        wasn't easy, in parallel my mother bothered me with random tutors which I didn't even need, and with swimming
        lessons. I want to visualize to you, how valuable two hours per week are when you are under pressure and have to
        waste them on random crap: in a narrow hot and sandy path of cacti on each side, you narrow the path just a bit,
        so that walking this path becomes virtually impossible without blood. There is no time to be depressed when you
        are working hard. If you have a breakdown, you just move on, things have to get done, regardless of how you
        feel. Surprisingly, you feel amazing if you work and it feels meaningful to you, no matter how exhausting. I
        often wanted to quit the programming course, but I didn't, as I knew that I needed to persist. The programming
        course was hard, everyone in there was a 25-year-old IT professional or a computer science major. Gradually, it
        became easier as I got used to the pressure and got smarter and consequently more productive. Retrospectively,
        if I had quit, my life would have been over by now, these were critical moments and I'm lucky that I had the
        strength not to listen to anyone, including myself, and continued. Normal people think of moments when their
        lives could have taken a turn for the better, yet I took pleasure in realizing how grateful I must be that I
        made the leap and didn't start to live a life of quiet desperation. At that point, I was still full of energy
        fueled by resentment. Then in the spring of '22, the programming course finally ended. At the end thereof, I
        forgot most of what I learned, but I didn't forget how to teach myself things and how to work super hard. I used
        two months after the end of the programming course to push harder on YouTube, I created 375 shorts of
        time-lapses and slow-motion videos, but abandoned them, as I failed to innovate and began to stagnate. </p>

    <p><strong><em>I had enough, once and for all.</em></strong> My story could have ended if things took a turn in the
        following two weeks. Since I started my success journey, I always had a somewhat persistent desire to become a
        scientist, because I wanted to become one for practically my entire life. I doubted my life in the background, I
        kept thinking, that perhaps I would become a businessman, but then also be an inventor on the side. I kept
        overthinking it, even if the voice was quiet at times as the golden leaves fell from the trees. But then, I had
        an internship at my local university in the Department for Computer Science and Electronics… Dear heavens! I
        didn't exactly hate it, but I strongly disliked how it felt. I realized that I wanted to get more out of life, I
        didn't want to become a beta male like those people there, I didn't want to live my life in a laboratory doing
        some nonsense on the computer while the highest pleasure was a beer with my friends or some 'search for truth'
        which would go without results anyway. I didn't want to wear a checkered shirt, ever. I simply didn't want such
        a life where you would sit down on the balcony of this white cubic building and think about science. I didn't
        want to have children and an ugly wife who would challenge my authority. I didn't want a life like that. Every
        fantasy of me being a scientist broke apart instantly. It's hard to describe what exactly happened to me, I just
        felt that this life wasn't right for me and that I would deeply dislike it. This was it. I thought to myself:
    </p>

    <p><em>“I had enough, there is nothing worse than that! Now I will have to make sure that's not the life I'm going
            to live.” </em></p>

    <p>Every successful person has had a moment in their life where they thought, 'I had enough' and this moment,
        generates so much motivation, it's unbelievable. Becoming successful is hard, unless you eliminate every
        alternative. Talking of a reason to get out of bed? This event motivated me so much that I didn't even need
        discipline. From now on, I had to spend every minute avoiding this destiny. </p>

    <p><em>“Removing the possibility of failure establishes the certainty of success. There is an anecdote for that. A
            general landed at the enemy's shore and decided to burn the ships that got them there. Now everyone knew
            that they had to win and could not lose. This adds certainty beyond what is expected to a point where it
            almost brings relief. Sometimes in life, you throw dice, and you don't know which number it's going to land,
            you just know that it has to land a six. No matter what math tells us here, it just has to.” -text #122</em>
    </p>

    <p>I could have skipped the description of the year that preceded or followed because this event alone was painful
        enough. I didn't want the highest pleasure of my life to be one where I stood in the parking lot and ate fries.
        This event alone made it clear to me, how I'm supposed to live and how not. </p>


    <p><strong><em>Pushing hard.</em></strong> Then, one of the hardest weeks of my life started in the summer holidays
        of '22 where I did nothing but program. It was horrible to have no clue how to do anything and still to push
        hard because the goal was clear and energy was abundant. That's what you are young for - working dumb to become
        smart. Every day in the summer of '22 I worked as hard as you can work only if you are broken and young. If I
        hadn't done it out of intrinsic motivation, I would simply be unable to do it. The autumn of '22 started and I
        had become increasingly better at programming. I started to realize that I needed to develop my body. I was
        motivated by the gym class, where we had to do 37 pushups in 30 seconds. I tried to do some pushups and could
        hardly do 5. So, I started to do 150 pushups a day until I figured them out and also, I started to do 50 pullups
        a day, despite starting with not even being capable of doing one when I started. Programming is hard. You have
        no clue how to do anything most of the time. And every time I felt like giving up, I simply ran outside and did
        some pull-ups. This went on until December '22. Step by step, I got better with programming to the point where a
        bunch of time was released, and some of the deep pressure and pain I had for a long time was starting to get
        released. In December '22 I was already in 11th grade and I started to become social, after having started to
        talk to someone and also after an inspiring school trip with my classmates which we had a deep conversation on
        the train ride back. Also, in December '22 I started to fix another area of my life, I started to break free
        from digital addiction after it had haunted me for a long time, every time I became too exhausted to do
        something, I would waste my time on the internet, which added up to 8000 hours of my youth, equaling to an
        entire year. As I calculated these estimated 8000 hours, it was so painful that I started to cry. It was painful
        enough for me to get annoyed and resentful to the point where I started to cut it out completely for two weeks
        and slowly started to cut it out until April 2nd, 2023 when I wasted time on the internet for the last time. In
        March '23 I started to develop an interest in a girl, but I knew quite well that I simply wasn't attractive
        enough, so I set myself a deadline for June to ask her out. I still hadn't mastered my social skills. I was
        still very dissatisfied with my life, as I had many unresolved traumas. On a random April night, all my traumas
        faded as I visualized telling my story to this girl twice. My story is more than my self-improvement ... The
        next day I woke up free, yet with a fever. In April and May, I still pushed very hard and started to perfect my
        life. I started my current YouTube channel in March '23, on self-improvement. I woke up every day at 5, went for
        a walk, to school, and then returned home, worked hard, went to the gym, went for a two-hour walk, worked hard,
        and then went to sleep. Even during the lessons at school, I continued to work. I seemed to be on the right
        course, every area of my life was improving, I still had my immense drive, and the dissatisfaction I had
        released energy in abundance. </p>

    <p>I thought, now I reached the ideal life. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Continue living this way? No, a decline after 31 months of nonstop work.</em></strong> At the end of
        May, I thought, if I were to continue living this way, my life would approach perfection very fast. Now I only
        had to maintain my lifestyle and everything would go my way. Slowly something unexpected happened. I started to
        go for walks and went up in tears on them. The pressure was just large, 2.5 years of nonstop doing. Many
        failures have added themselves up and I could no longer. 'Failures make stronger' but in reality, failures kill.
        I coped thinking because I fixed every problem I had. Maybe I needed the traumas to push me further. Anyway, the
        deadline for June 1st was approaching and I had to ask out the girl because I promised it to myself. After
        thinking on June 1st, that she wanted to have nothing to do with me, I had a horrible week of overthinking. My
        grandmother told me to ask her out anyway and I got rejected. Pain. For two more weeks in June, I kept pushing
        and working hard, I still had a lot of motivation inside of me. Yet, I couldn't ignore that my creativity
        started to run dry and my productivity dropped to zero towards the end of May. Then, for ten days towards the
        end of June, I did nothing and burned out so to speak. That didn't matter too much, I was still very resentful
        and decided to push harder on discipline, for example, I stopped listening to music until September '23. The
        summer was colorful and refreshing, full of hard work. During the summer holidays of '23, I developed a lot and
        lived fully disciplined, the summer was a great time, despite getting rejected by this girl and being unable to
        process it. As the school year started in September, things took a bit of a turn. I started to push hard a last
        time on the app I started to develop in the spring of '22 and I had to confess to myself that it failed after
        the 3rd and biggest ad campaign. I was a bit lost, but not quite, because I still had two apps on the side, both
        mental math apps, just like the first one, but for different target groups, one of them for older people. I
        started to push hard on that app to see whether I was able to at least make this one successful. For two weeks,
        I occupied myself with it and then it too failed. I was free so to speak. </p>

    <p><strong><em>I felt bliss for a while, but then it all deteriorated. </em></strong> I enjoyed my newfound freedom
        for two weeks of bliss and inspiration. For the first time, I saw something resembling spiritual enlightenment
        in mid-September. Nevertheless, it all started to collapse quickly. I completely lost my discipline already at
        the beginning of September, to the death time of my first app. There is no such thing as 'being disciplined
        without pressure'. What hit me in September as well was that this girl who rejected me back in June who I still
        had hope for, bragged to her friends how great a random loser was, to which I wondered what the hell I was doing
        with my life. What do you need success for, huh? It hurt a lot and I kept overthinking it for 6 weeks, yet
        little did I know that the autumn of '23 would get a lot worse. In the final class trip to Venice, I was put to
        the test whether I'm really that disciplined. 'You have to eat sweets, otherwise you'll have a massive burnout'
        Weakened, I fell for that propaganda and became even weaker. The following two weeks in October were even worse
        than those after the rejection coupled with the burnout. There was a lot of dissatisfaction, but I was unable to
        transmute it into productivity. This sort of pain didn't release enough energy, it paralyzed instead. I started
        to increase the pressure, for example, by deciding to get up at 3:30 and it half-worked. I would write amazing
        texts at that time, but still, I wasn't able to regain my discipline; if you write 2000 words a day in the
        morning, what do you do for the rest of the day, having nothing to do is what makes one unable to resist lower
        pleasures. At Christmas '23 I got a bit depressed for a few days and it stayed until late January in a lighter
        form because I was weakened. My health took a hit as well. From December 1st to February 29th, I set myself the
        goal to complete 50 videos, hoping it would give me a purpose, but recording a 10-minute video only takes 30
        minutes, what do you do in the time that follows? I grew complacent and it made me sick. I had too little
        pressure and purpose in my life, I had too much time. Having fixed every major problem I had, what was there
        left to do? Linger around half-depressed and complacent? </p>

    <p><strong><em>I liked my life too much.</em></strong> In January, February, and March 2024, slowly, step by step, I
        was able to give my life meaning back. I realized that I grew complacent because I liked my life too much. I
        reached a perfectly meaningful life too. I would spend my time writing, recording videos, doing sports, and
        going for walks. I was living in freedom and prosperity. I did what I found meaningful practically all day long,
        there is no need for discipline in that situation. I suffered from complacency because I enjoyed my life too
        much, I was genuinely happy about it. Yet, this happiness made me unable to live hardcore disciplined, and
        improving, which is necessary for true happiness for me as a man. The fulfillment of pushing hard is greater
        than indulging in what has been built over the past years. There is no point in getting out of bed when you are
        happy. The voice that tells you to push harder dies when you reach perfection and live your life like you
        authentically dreamt of doing - which makes you suffer and complacent, it strips a lot of life's meaning. But
        somehow, I was able to restore my will to push hard, despite having grown complacent. </p>

    <p>How was I able to overcome complacency and push hard despite having my dream life? That's what this text will
        answer and that's what took long for me to figure out, ever since losing my app. This is doubtless one of the
        most impactful texts I have written so far, as the problem I'm solving is a pretty big one. How to not become a
        fat beta male at the age of 50? How to give life meaning? How to push hard while being happy? How to generate a
        will so strong it can move mountains? </p>

    <h1>3. You don't want complacency</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Standstill is deadly.</em></strong> Things have to grow, otherwise they deteriorate. A house no one
        cared after breaks window by window, brick by brick, a tree that gets energy from the sun can survive for a
        thousand years. Complacency makes you stagnant. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Life is paradise.</em></strong> In so-called paradise, there is no reason to be alive. Truly, none.
        As soon as you have everything, there is no reason to exist. There is no deeper meaning that can be summoned,
        instead, only cheap pleasures remain. Listening to elegant music is inspiring. Assuming that the joy doesn't
        slowly evaporate, listening to your favorite music for eternity is torture. In paradise, danger doesn't exist
        and this makes consciousness redundant, hence you can't exist, since you can't be aware of your existence. If we
        constructed paradise on earth, people would find pleasure in destroying paradise just to prove their point.
        Hence, life itself is the true paradise, in this one, there is, at least for some, reason good enough to thrust
        out of the cozy feathers. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Paradise is horrible.</em></strong> If your life resembles classical paradise, i.e. with near
        limitless pleasure, safety, comfort, and free of real challenge, adventure, danger, and enemies your life
        probably isn't particularly worth living. Some people have a job where they do the bare minimum and come home,
        without any pressure and stress just to indulge in safety and warmth, they entertain themselves with technology.
        Truly, what does this person need to take a book in their hands? You know what the person who lives in excessive
        comfort without any authentic danger is called - a loser. They are content with their shallow lives. To the
        truest sense of the expression, what work hard for, when you can generate happiness at will? You can go to your
        football club and do some sports there. You can watch TV and go to the bakery. You can eat your fries and stand
        in the parking lot in the sun free of pressure and ambition. Short - why not become complacent? The pain of
        complacency isn't <em>too bad</em>.</p>

    <p><strong><em>The problems with complacency.</em></strong> The mind and the muscles work the best if they are
        trained and used frequently, not if neglected because one is happy with being stupid and fat. This point is kept
        kind of broad as I assume you already know it; it's obvious that if you don't see a reason to get out of bed you
        get weak and sick. This is not how humans are supposed to live. Let's dive deeper. The average German reads 7
        minutes a day, which is terrible by all means, with that pace I write faster than the average person reads. When
        was the last time your parents read something? What I'm daring to claim is that the question of when your
        parents picked up a book for the last time is strongly related to the question: When did your parents have sex
        for the last time? This sentence alone could make for an excellent doctorate work, I think the data would
        indicate a strong link. Why that is you may ask? Well, if you give up on life and just linger and say<em>'Let's
            buy some furniture on the weekend'</em> you have nothing to do with the attractive person you may have been,
        you become the shell of a man who no one is attracted to. If you are distanced from your core, i.e. your
        purpose, there is no masculine energy left, therefore the attraction fades and your wife, children, and peers
        start to question your authority. You become a horrible role model and decline as a person. A couple who doesn't
        even read; what the hell are they doing with their life, to not have the time to read 10 pages a day? This line
        of thinking can be extended practically forever… Complacent men are weak. Weak men are unattractive. It's as
        simple as that. Being complacent in life and stopping to read in particular accelerates mental decline.
        Complacency can also not only contribute to depression but also cause such, because of how unnatural it is. It
        strips the joy out of life pretty effectively. Complacency is not only weakness itself, it's a bit spicier; you
        lose the energy needed to advance. Weakness is not being able to ask out your crush. Complacency is not wanting
        to ask out your crush in the first place. Weakness therefore can be overcome with enough determination, yet for
        complacency, there is no self-evident counter except for unhappiness. However, unhappiness itself can contribute
        to complacency if it's not transmuted productively or if it isn't plentiful. </p>


    <h1>4. Where complacency comes from</h1>

    <p>I started to write this text at the beginning of March and I was genuinely asking myself the question, what do
        you need success for if you can be 'happy' without it? I started to grow content with life, I started to grow
        complacent and it wasn't as painful as I imagined it to be. I thoughts, this spiritual stuff is making me
        content. My heart got warmer and less resentful, so why try hard if you have people you love? I thought, now I'm
        growing up and slowing down. Nonetheless, after thinking about this question, I realized that my assumptions
        were simply not correct. You can love others and still be able to cross boundaries. This spiritual stuff doesn't
        slow down. You can become older and more energized… You can generate energy out of nothing, even if you are
        happy. Overcoming my complacency was possible. Overcoming your complacency will be. </p>

    <p>Let's dive very deep into what creates complacency.</p>

    <p><strong><em>A. Growing up it's called and meaning it does losing one's passion.</em></strong> </p>

    <p><em>- I want to get more out of life. Growing up is a lie. Everything is trying to strip me of ambition and
            energy. </em></p>

    <p><em>-No, you will grow up and realize that it's all for nothing, the world is not as straightforward as it's
            tempting to think or to hope when looking in the starred sky. Enjoy the wonders of being young and innocent.
            Sunsets are vibrant and when you grow up not so much anymore. Love is hot and passionate as a teenager but
            then it all evaporates. That's how life is.</em></p>

    <p>You can see the drops in a boring car ride through the city and see them turning golden as the sun shines
        through, the bus takes a turn, and the drops turn grey again because of the asphalt behind them. This is a
        simple and beautiful impression; the only conscious person noticing it was you. You look around, sitting in the
        bus, and see, how everyone grew up and has better things to do than to look at the raindrops. Ask any child what
        they want out of their lives and no one is going to say that they want the life of their parents. The life of
        their parents doesn't make a lot of fun… Grey. Every child who 'hasn't grown up' will have wild dreams and
        almost immaterializeable desires. They want to live crazy outlandish lives, but they must be taught that those
        lives are not real or not tangible or not what they authentically desire in the first place. How nice it is to
        eat fries in a parking lot instead… Why pursue, if that's the life you can get instead? When these children
        become teenagers, they will be taught something similar. </p>

    <p><em>'You are not part of the elite and never will be. The elite exist and you have nothing in common with them.
            They are the ones who will get the sweetest cherries, not you. You have to accept that you will never become
            great. You were never meant to become great in the first place. You must realize, that these elites aren't
            happy with their lives either, they are the most broken people beneath the façade. They are all detached
            antisocial manipulators and all of them have superiority complexes. They aren't particularly loving; they
            are ruthless and cold instead. You don't want to live like that. Be careful what you wish for, it may as
            well come true. You will lose a lot of your youthful energy and slow down. Your ambitious phase is going to
            end very soon and we will welcome you for growing up. That's reality. Grow up and accept that. Growing up
            it's called and meaning it does losing one's passion.'</em><br>- Maybe complacency is inevitable?</p>

    <p>I'm scared of university. I may end up liking it because it may not get horrible enough. Maybe I will slow down
        and start to think to myself that this new life isn't as bad as I imagined. Eating sweets doesn't kill you,
        contrary to what I convinced myself of, so why not eat more? If I end up liking university, the job, and then
        retirement, I may as well stop writing forever. How can I write how ambitious I am when I may grow complacent in
        university? </p>

    <p>A dictator has two dilemmas. When to modernize and when to isolate? If the dictator doesn't modernize, the
        people's life gets worse. If he does modernize, he risks exposing the people to ideas that make his legitimacy
        doubtable, on the flip side, the people's lives improve. The second dilemma is the question of how much violence
        is necessary to intimidate but not to generate backstabbers without ends. If he is not violent at all, he will
        be overthrown for sure, everyone else will just take the power. If he is too Machiavellian, he will be
        overthrown for sure, people will not fear losing anything. </p>

    <p>The same applies here. Is the threshold for silent desperate resentment large enough? I will doubtlessly generate
        a will large enough to break free from the shallow life of a programmer, which I don't want in the first place.
        I hate programming and the beta males that program. I moved on from this level a long time ago, since the death
        of my app 6 months ago I didn't touch programming. If I enjoy it just enough, time won't get bad enough and I
        will have not a large enough incentive to change. Will I be able to feel as if I have nothing to lose and fight
        hard to overcome this existence? The memory from '22 of the internship that motivated me to push so that I don't
        end up with the life of a programmer is fading slowly. Will I settle because I get used and my life won't get as
        bad as I now think it would? When you get older, energy fades, and you get used to things. The question remains
        whether enough energy and resistance will remain for me to not settle on a shallow life. I have no reason to
        assume anything.</p>

    <p><strong><em>B. Time to be antisocial. </em></strong> </p>

    <p>People at the top are impossible to be around, that's true and not exclusively something peasants construct as
        excuses. We need to dive a bit deeper. In the past few months, starting in October, I dropped my arrogance,
        superiority complex, and judgmental attitude by around 80% out of pain. In the months following, after getting
        rejected by the same girl again, I started to change as a person to become more loving and less judgmental and
        resentful. It was a rather slow development and it seemed to work slowly. I became a lot more loving and
        judgmental than I used to be. Initially, I pretended to develop, but later it started to manifest itself. Often,
        I fluctuated between being judgmental and loving. I was in quantum superposition so to speak. I started to like
        other people a lot more for no reason. I know, never change your mind to please someone, but my attitude was a
        problem I had and was aware of, however, the girl didn't start to like me, and liking others for no reason
        brought some pretty severe problems beyond that. It robbed my drive. What do you need to become successful, if
        you love the people around you? Why push hard, when there is love in abundance?</p>

    <p>I was genuinely disgusted when looking at 90% of people. I wanted to have nothing to do with them. Before
        December '22, when I was still deep in working hard on my app mode and before I started to socialize before I
        started to break free from digital addiction, I thought to myself that I missed nothing by not socializing in
        the first place and by continuing to work on myself. I judged people harshly so that I could generate momentum
        to not become one of them myself. I was a lot lower than most of them in many areas, but this harsh attitude
        accelerated me. Since I'm better, I must materialize that, I reasoned. Some may have had a complete soul, I
        didn't, but they used social media and went to parties, which I despised, so I generated energy not to become
        them. I got rid of digital addiction partially to feel superior. That's essentially ruthless overcompensation,
        but when you keep overcompensating, you end up with more and faster, so, I got a repaired soul and a life set up
        much better in the end. I know that this paragraph is a bit confusing, but just trust me, if you hate everyone
        around you because you view them as less, you generate a lot of energy to surpass them all. That's something I
        would never say in person, but I know that some friends of mine drink essentially water with sugar and other
        poison, and another friend drinks milk. I judge them, regardless of my will, I think to myself, what the hell
        are you doing with your life? And rightly so, what are you doing with your life if you drink anything outside of
        water? Some guys from school smoke marijuana, party, use the internet constantly, and do essentially nothing
        productive, yet still have enjoyable personalities, to which I cope: let a bit of time pass. Such a guy has an
        amazing personality and an excellent sense of humor, however, I think I'm pushing by far the hardest and my
        circumstances were very misaligned initially. I'm the most ruthless person when it comes to dedication, to a
        large part because I judge harshly. I do not have a positive opinion of most people I encounter, particularly
        those who exhibit passive or submissive behavior, for short, the betas. </p>

    <p>Regarding arrogance, another realization came a few days ago. In comparison to others, I'm not arrogant. We are
        simply different, however, I realized that every human experiences effectively the same things; heartbreak,
        stress, or loss, hence, one must stop thinking that one's life is too unique. Some people know their problems
        and don't fix them, blaming that no one understands them and that they need to figure things out themselves. In
        my opinion, that's supreme arrogance. The person who struggles with discipline and doesn't listen to disciplined
        people is the arrogant one, not the one who says that discipline is great after figuring things out after years
        of struggle. When I say, to make your brain stop bullying you, simply don't let in the thoughts when they come
        knocking on your door and do pushups instead, the arrogant person will not even think about attempting it and
        simply discard it as 'this worked for you, doesn't mean it's going to work for me'. I never had this type of
        arrogance, I just thought I was superior and needed to prove that, also if included to learn from others and
        swallowing one's ego when it is necessary. I know that I'm dumb and need to read, I never intrinsically deluded
        myself into thinking I'm a genius. Here comes the twist, if you know that the person you are talking to has
        severe problems in their life, and doesn't listen to advice that works, maybe this person is not a good one to
        be around.</p>

    <p>But, since I started to drop my harsh, judgmental, and arrogant attitude, what changed in my beliefs? Well, my
        beliefs are now a lot weaker and more internal and I started to talk to people, believe it or not! I understand
        that I get depressed by living slowly, but now I understand that others don't. I understand that if I hadn't
        been through the nonsense I've been through I would be a lot more content with mediocrity. </p>

    <p><em>“I do not like that man. I must get to know him better” - Lincoln</em></p>

    <p>Having started to talk to people whom I usually never would talk to, I got to know many of them better. When I
        visualize them in front of me, I do not feel dislike anymore. I'm moving in the Christian direction, how loving…
        However, it's an illusion to some extent 'to do things out of love'. Certainly, you can do things out of love if
        you love your girl or want to retire your parents, but this is irrelevant in the context of being accepting of
        everyone around you. Which person, what do you think, is going to find more success, the one who sees a loser
        and finds deep disgust in that or the person who loves all? When you stop to judge, you open yourself - also for
        harmful and weak ideas. For example, hearing that my friends have practically zero discipline, made my
        discipline significantly worse. When you start to talk to people and see that their lives are a total mess,
        suddenly your life doesn't seem to be that bad anymore; you grow complacent.</p>

    <p>Consequently, not judging, being open, and loving too much weakens one, their attitudes start to infect. I want
        to get more out of my life. I'm sorry if you are too weak to break free from social media and cope by saying
        that you learn something by being on it; I don't need your weakness in my life. If you at least try to quit and
        haven't done it, I doubt you are trying hard enough, I bet, you are growing complacent in your journey. I will
        continue to like this person, yet that doesn't mean spending time with them will move me forward. Some people
        are friends, nice to be around, and terrible to advance yourself. These people may want deep in their hearts the
        best for you, but this doesn't change that their ideas will weaken you. Accept some momentary loneliness. </p>

    <p>When you are arrogant, you are resentful. Resentment is a force and you can bloody well transmute it into
        determination. One time in August '23, I solved 10.000 mental math tasks in my app to demonstrate its
        superiority and my commitment, innovation, and determination. It took something like 11 hours. Do you think that
        would have been possible if I was full of love if I was hugging my mother? No, it stems from a feeling of
        superiority. Of course, one could have done it out of love in the deeper sense, but this was not what kept me
        going in the moment I wanted to quit. I mean, I certainly did it for my future family, but that's not what kept
        me going. Feeling superior, you can cross certain boundaries other people wouldn't dare to. There are many
        things I have no clue of and no idea how I would handle them, yet still, my self-perception makes me think that
        I'm capable thereof. I know fairly precisely what I'm capable of. Successful people are extremely conscious and
        self-aware and that renders them incapable of being sheep, they view themselves as the shepherd and start to act
        accordingly. The shepherd is certainly evil in the eyes of most sheep. </p>

    <p>Maybe it's time to abandon love for all for a while - Yet, God sent me a pretty clear sign of how I should act
        and a change towards the loving side was necessary. Being judgmental works only as long as you don't need help,
        it could be a loser who saves your life. </p>

    <p>Unfortunately, modern society offers no real community, every community is either few and far apart or a cult.
        Trying to stick together with the people you have may be unproductive. In a world where classmates are on their
        phones during the breaks, you accelerate by abandoning even more than they do. Why try to maintain community
        with them, if they aren't your true friends? That's how it is and that's how it's going to stay, the only way to
        revert this trend is to become strong and then to act. Becoming strong, however, requires you to stop
        complacency, which includes sacrifice and turning away from people. Or at least shut up on discipline and goals
        with your friends, but that makes me doubt what you need your 'friends' in the first place if you can't talk
        about your life with them.</p>

    <p>Decide which one you want. Love for everybody or drive from a resentful arrogance. You can have both when you
        love very few people with your full heart and dismiss the rest. But this is a choice only you can make, only you
        can decide who to love and who to resent. </p>

    <p><em>I enjoy bragging about my life, I make it no secret who I am, I talk best about the shallowness of the
            average life. I find it amusing to compare myself, especially to those below. Those above, they shall know,
            I'm coming. That's what I do best. That's what I can do. That's what I enjoy. ─ Yet, I grew increasingly
            humble, and compassionate and almost started quietly to find the average life meaningful. I find no pleasure
            in comparison; I understand that they have no idea of how great my life is. I started to tolerate, accept,
            and love. Maybe it's time for me to grow up and live a quiet life. Maybe that's how life is supposed to be
            lived. You start young, full of energy, and then you realize that everything is a lie and slow down. Life is
            simple: children run around and adults walk slowly. The sky is starry when you are young; as you get older,
            one star goes out after the other until none are left and the sky turns into eternal darkness. No light
            without darkness, but every darkness without light. Forever. ─ But no, I refuse to. I want to get more out
            of life.</em></p>


    <p><strong><em>C. Let's go and buy some furniture on the weekend!</em></strong> </p>

    <p>People like to be busy. One of the biggest lessons one has to learn is that paradise is not desirable because
        there is nothing to do. Having nothing to do is one of the worst feelings one can have. Having nothing to do for
        two hours spent on the beach is nice. For prolonged periods the effects of having nothing to do equal
        complacency. Consequently, people busy themselves artificially. A few examples are garden work, pets, or even
        the volleyball club. Those things are completely redundant, and unproductive and don't even make fun, at least I
        don't perceive it as fun if my mother wants me to carry her over-dimensional agave plants up and down. Looking a
        bit further, people like to be busy so much that they invented kindergarten, school, and work. I know that it's
        a vastly oversimplified perspective but hear me out; where in the world does work make sense if the only thing
        one does is sit silently in a random presentation someone gives which you have no interest in? The email app got
        an update that made it significantly more difficult to use, just for the update to get reverted two months
        later, that's a perfect example of useless work. Most work is redundant or inefficient, I argue. Sure, it only
        exists since humans aren't machines. However, we can go a bit further here. I suppose humans planted seeds so
        that they could feel productive. Yet, by planting a seed they brought a lot of misery, disease, and malnutrition
        and most importantly, hunting took a lot less time than farming. Is this where history took a wrong turn? Let's
        put these rather philosophical questions aside and get concrete again. If your daily work consists of chores
        predominantly, it provides the perfect ground to be complacent. If you have to pick up your children from
        school, then drive to the store, then have an appointment at the county council, … it practically forces you
        into complacency and removes the time when you could be doing things to stop your stagnation in life. If you can
        distract yourself from doing unyielding tasks, why should you be growing? Growing is painful? Why grow by doing
        and learning, if you can work in the garden and learn about plants? Buying furniture on the weekend may be nice,
        yet, what for, to buy more nonsense and to fill it? You have to be doing something, so better choose to do the
        right things. You either work on things that make you grow or on things that don't. This aspect has no real
        practical tip I can give you if you already set up your life. Otherwise, I would recommend freeing as much time
        as possible, for example, by living with your parents so that you can build yourself up. There is no point in
        moving away for the sake of 'being free' to do laundry on your own. People enjoy to feel productive, hence, they
        create problems out of thin air.</p>

    <p><strong><em>D. Fine-tuned misalignment</em></strong> </p>

    <p>It seems the world is as fine-tuned as razor blades balancing on top of each other. Everything wants you to give
        up on life. Yet, when they are standing on razor blades, shouldn't one be able to bring the lie to collapse? No,
        because the hedonistic temptations are as fine-tuned as razor blades but not razor blades themselves. They are
        soft mattresses that can even stay intact after being thrown out of the plane. Life seems to be designed for
        peasants, but also for those who rise above. Yet, seeing how to rise above is difficult, it is about unlearning
        what you thought to be dearest. You choose which one you want to be in every decision you make. It's not where
        you started but where you are going that makes the difference in the long run. If you chose to be a peasant,
        many pleasures are awaiting you, if you chose to rise above, be ready; the hammer beats the tallest nail.
        Luckily, true peasants want to be one, they don't notice how everything is designed to exploit them. Sunday,
        Saturday, Friday, Thursday, … they are not real. Every day is equally interesting and fulfilling as an eagle.
        From a peasant's perspective, my life is boring, which seems absurd to me, I know what my years look like and I
        know that theirs consist of very little, except for weekends where nothing ever happens. 'What did you do this
        weekend?' 'Well not much happened, how about you'… They find happiness, they seem to have it all. For
        loneliness, boredom, progress, and almost every other modern problem there's the internet. The world is
        designed, it seems, in such a way that living as the average person sucks but isn't horrible. That brings us
        back to the application of the dictator's dilemma in the abstracted context. As long as it doesn't get bad and
        existential suffering doesn't reach a boiling point, nothing changes, even if the changes would make life
        significantly more worth living. One of those things that make you content with your life is music. Music can
        make even the most boring moment feel amazing, it adds magic to one's life and binds people together. Most
        people can't live without it, as if it was an addiction. Even worse, they are so addicted that earphones exist.
        Every moment must be pleasure and entertainment. You just feel great if you are in the club and you vibe to a
        song everyone loves. Yet, those are horrible outcomes, you don't want to feel amazing when you should be
        depressed, you should add magic to your life by working hard and you don't want to bond with the average person.
        Unless you are two hours outdoors every day, eating clean, reading an hour a day, and training hard you should
        be depressed, any other way of life is not natural. Music is one component of how to make life more enjoyable
        when it shouldn't be enjoyable in the slightest. Driving in a car is not fun if you are forced to do it for
        hours on end, without music you wouldn't be able to stand it. By the way, pleasure numbs, it makes you unable to
        work hard and break free from being a peasant. Music is a psychological weapon, you may not listen to nonstop
        degenerate weak lyrics consciously, yet, if you know anything about psychology, their effect is real
        nonetheless. Do you seriously think that having an earworm of 'shake your asses doesn't do anything with your
        mind? You are seriously out of mind if you try to defend listening to music outside of that which elevates the
        soul. Beethoven would be glad to be deaf when he saw modern songs. Modern music is one of the tools to make you
        into a peasant. There are many other things used to make life feel better. For example, sugar gets added to food
        to make it tastier, but also to hide that it's not real and natural food. Without sugar, most 'food' is
        uneatable. People try to cope by saying that there is no food free of sugar anymore, but that's incorrect, ever
        heard of potatoes? Culture itself, not only modern culture, seems to idolize many instances of instant
        gratification, for example, the phrase 'I'll go to the bakery now real quick', is predominant in Germany. It
        seems odd to me why anyone should do that. Sure, Brötchen are tasty. But carbohydrates make one stupid, slow,
        and fat. Try it yourself. Don't eat anything for a day and you will notice that you can read fantastically. But
        when you eat carbohydrates, you can't recall anything you read, you can't focus in the slightest, and at random
        you start to think about cursed memories. “But Kiryl, you must know that in reality there is no such thing as
        food that makes stupid, otherwise children in Africa focus” - Well, I got more loving recently, so I respect
        that this person doesn't have this specific knowledge since the last time they read was two decades ago. They
        can't know that carbohydrates make them stupid if they don't read and are missing this knowledge… It remains
        mysterious to me, why would anyone want to eat bread in the morning, and eat right after waking up? After waking
        up you should starve for as long as possible and then eat protein. Peasants instead eat bread as the first thing
        of the day, they do everything the wrong way. Do you know what I eat in the morning? Nothing. Then, I eat meat.
        My mind doesn't slow down from it. If you aren't in your right mind, it's impossible to write deep texts. In
        fact, my output is proportional to how healthy I live… There's an infinite number of things that make the
        average life more desirable and provide excellent ways to cope. How can anyone be sad when you eat cake with
        coffee on a warm Sunday with family or friends in the garden? How can one refuse to watch television, after all,
        you have to stay informed about what's going on in the world (and also about which products to buy to plug your
        deep existential hole). How can one refuse to enjoy being young? The modern world goes a bit further, many
        people don't generate a desire to get a girlfriend, because the internet shows women with skin, even if those
        images aren't nude or provoking ones, it strips many, including myself when I used to use the internet, not to
        pursue what is real… 'Let's go and spend our weekend looking for furniture.' 'Aren't scented candles nice to
        ignite with your family?' 'Come on, apple spritzer once a year isn't that bad.' 'Eat sweets, otherwise, you are
        going to have a massive burnout' </p>

    <p>How dare you not to go to youth consecration! <em>“I knew that this wasn't something authentic I wanted to do and
            I had no problems resisting the peer pressure surrounding it. I didn't desire to peak at a party. I don't
            know how a person can desire to let life happen to them instead of gripping life with claws. I refused to
            participate; I knew I didn't want to have this memory. I couldn't fathom constructing myself a life where I
            follow what the crowd does. At that time, I was already incompatible with the rest, so why should I follow
            and pretend as if I was setting sails for an ordinary life? When I look back on the time, I was 13 or 14
            years old, I already had done a few things no normal person would do, I had a programming course for adults
            and I skipped 9th grade. Sounds short, but this was more than enough to do, I have more than enough
            memories, and none of them were external or inauthentic. I didn't want to peak at a party. Yes, it may also
            have played a role that I was deeply hurt and full of aggressive traumas and with little bondage to the
            other people my age, but this would be an incomplete representation. Do I regret not going to that event?
            No, everyone who is not a complete peasant will tell you that it was so far below expectations that it
            crushed them.” - text #110</em></p>

    <p>Things in modern life make you content. Remember the beginning of this text, the parking lot? Without music the
        fries and the fast car, there would have been nothing to feel a deep bliss for. You are probably happy with your
        life only because of technology and because culture says that instant gratification in balance is good. You
        know, to hell with your balance! What do you expect from eating bread for breakfast? If what you eat can be
        called bread at all. For something purely negative, there is no reason to introduce balance. Do you think hard
        drugs are good in moderation? Of course not! My views qualify as extremist because of the widespread weakness.
        Weakness will cause societies' collapse, so better grow strong to prevent catastrophe! </p>

    <p>The core of this text is complacency. If you are happy with going to the bakery every Sunday, there is truly no
        reason to try hard with everything you do. You may as well just quit doing sports. There is no point in reading
        books on how to grow as a person if you grow as a person in the physical sense enough and are happy with it.
        There is no reason to get up at 3:30 if the only thing you have to do is watch TV and eat cake. If you are happy
        with your life and killed any ambition already, there is no reason to try hard. That's when hedonism remains the
        only thing left. If you don't have reason enough to get out of bed, that's complacency. As if free will meant
        that… not being able to use one's own mind and body. A truly horrible state of existence to be in. </p>

    <p><em>It seems as if most people have given up on life. And rightly so - they have. Now they linger until death,
            and want to get the last bits of pleasure before their otherwise horrible existence ceases to exist. </em>
    </p>

    <p>How do you escape this artificial nonsense chaining you? By cutting out modern nonsense and not being a snowflake
        about it! It's simple, but not easy. Remove music from your life. Remove any unhealthy food. Don't eat until
        your most important work is done. Ask out the 10/10 and get rejected. Wake up so early that it hurts. Generate
        enough anger to shower cold only. Don't use public transit too often, run to the places you are supposed to go.
        If you haven't a six-pack naturally, make it your goal to get one. Refuse to listen to 'you need to eat sweets
        otherwise you are going to have a massive burnout' or similar nonsense and refuse to spend time with people who
        you know are slowing you down. Refuse to stimulate yourself and if you have to rest lie in bed with nothing.
        That should give you reason enough to push hard if you deprive yourself of modern comfort. It will make you
        realize that nothing about the modern world is real and that the only truth lies within fighting and resisting.
        As soon as you start to hate the life you are trapped in, you will be able to change. You already know which
        pleasures aren't real and which ones you need to sacrifice to live a more meaningful life. </p>

    <p>The enjoyment of the modern world isn't real or deep. There is no pleasure to eating cake beyond the momentary
        taste, and even that is doubtable and how your teeth feel afterward… Therefore, rejecting modern pleasures will
        make your life, contrary to intuition, more fulfilling because the deeper pleasures, such as the one from trying
        hard, skyrocket in significance. But then, you may be asking yourself, why, if you reject modern pleasures, do
        you want spirituality?</p>

    <p><strong><em>E. The spiritual lie.</em></strong></p>

    <p>Spirituality offers some comfort and makes insane hardship bearable in the first place. Spirituality is giving up
        control and faith in the process. It is also about finding peace and fulfillment. Or to put it in Karl Marx's
        terms, religion is an opioid, to numb and instill docility, and to delude their reality. Marx therefore argued,
        that if we were to abandon the comfort that religion brings, the proletariat would wake up and realize that
        their lives are awful and take action in the form of a revolution. However, the farmers and workers don't care
        about revolutions enough because they have religion to cope with. To put it in my words: religion makes people
        complacent, at least to some extent. </p>

    <p><em>“Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against
            real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul
            of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness
            of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their
            condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.” - Karl Marx</em></p>

    <p>Religion is indeed used to justify inequality. Look at Hinduism for example, their castes exist to group people
        into clear social hierarchies based on karma from past lives. If one was bad, one would be reincarnated in a
        lower caste, and if one was decent and kept the caste one was in and followed its rules, one could hope to get
        the caste elevated. From a Christian perspective that's nonsense because isn't there something like free will?
        However, Christianity has its problems in this regard. Christianity wants one to be meek, yet meekness doesn't
        usually bring better survival to the self, so instead it promises justice in heaven. Many religions promise
        justice for suffering on earth.</p>

    <p>Christianity is complicated, so let me use another example, a philosophy/religion/spiritual affair, from the
        philosopher Sun Tzu and his book Tao Te Ching, from ancient China centered on yin and yang, harmony, wisdom,
        flow, subtraction, passivity, and simplicity. Try to read and interpret them.</p>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>These Taoist quotes convey the message of essentially giving up on life. Sure, some may view this as a
        counterbalance to every day which is filled with useless tasks. The way I interpret the Tao is to do what brings
        one in the flow, 'non-action' can also be translated as effortless action. That means, since I find no
        difficulty in writing, I should pursue it instead of forcing myself to do some affair I have no interest in, for
        example, medicine. Living your life in the flow and doing meaningful things only is a great existence. The
        themes of sacrificing and doing less are correct as well, for example, you don't need to buy the kitchen
        aggregate for 2 weeks of pay, 1500€, just to have it standing on the shelf for nothing, also because it has
        nothing to do with your meaningful work. It is also true that humility and harmony are important, the Tao will
        restore harmony; if you work too hard, you will burn out. The teaching of energies yin and yang is useful to
        everyday life, for example in relationship polarity. The most important teaching of Daoism is the idea of being
        free of concepts. One can lose the essence if one tries to think in concepts only, for example, seeing a person
        and categorizing them as a loser is a concept, yet being free of judgment is liberating. Being free of desires
        can be good if one stops to envy people and it's also good if one writes for the sake of writing rather than
        writing for the sake of money, writing as an example here. If one does not desire results, they often come on
        their own and bring even more fulfillment. You see, the Tao is useful to one's life. </p>

    <p>It seems, that the Tao is great and perhaps you are unable to point out any flaws in it unless you are opposed to
        it from the beginning. The Tao has a false assumption. Desires are the source of unhappiness. But the false part
        sets in here, we should abandon desires and just linger in happiness as a result! The thing with breaking free
        from every desire is that then there is no point in getting out of bed or to exist - that's complacency. Taken
        to the extreme, if one is free of desire, one can lose the reason to continue living. This 'deep fulfillment' is
        not something you should wish for, because if you are fulfilled, what do anything for? Don't get me wrong. Being
        free of desire for 15 minutes a day while meditating is great, but you don't want to structure your life around
        it if you want to live a meaningful one. Peaceful moments feel amazing, but not so when that's the only thing
        you do. You can find peace, but again, there is no reason to get out of bed then, instead you just linger. Your
        'mindfulness' inverts and becomes actual mindlessness. Saying 'moment, just linger, you are so beautiful' is
        breathtaking, but only for a short time. As soon as something is done, you are ready for the next thing. There
        is something inside of humans that makes us like that. You don't want to go too deep with this spiritual stuff.
    </p>

    <p>When you catch yourself thinking nonsense like 'it's better never to have been', stop thinking! You are too
        stupid to think straight, someone else should do it for you, otherwise, you are putting yourself fin great
        danger. You are overdoing philosophy and thinking.</p>

    <p>So, do not overdo the spiritual affairs. Don't mess up the orders. First, master the material. Then, master the
        spiritual. What the hell do you need spirituality for as a 16-year-old? </p>

    <p>I took apart the Tao here, but other philosophies/religions aren't much better. Aristotle's way of the middle
        sounds like giving up as well. The stoic thinks our only desire should be to live good lives or that we should
        be hard on ourselves and suppress our wishes. I know that complacency is one of the cardinal sins in
        Christianity and every other philosophy/religion, but still, Christianity has some similar ideas that want one
        to essentially give up on earthly life and embrace the spiritual one. </p>

    <p><em>“Then said Jesus unto his disciples, verily I say unto you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the
            kingdom of heaven. And again, I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,
            than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.” - Mattew 19:23-24</em></p>

    <p>How to not overdo spiritual stuff? Mediation for 15 minutes a day is great. It increases the attention span,
        creativity, discipline, mindfulness, memory, emotional control … and practically everything related to the mind.
        Mediation makes you think before you speak. It gives new insights because you give your mind time to think about
        things. It increases discipline and emotional control because you train yourself to discard annoying thoughts
        and wishes, such as a wish to curse or to eat sweets. The list of advantages is practically infinite. Mediation
        increases self-awareness and consciousness. Since consciousness is linked to one having a strong desire to rise
        above the peasants, mediation could increase the desire for an extraordinary life. Next to meditation, look at
        the sunset when you encounter one and enjoy the starriness of the sky. Pet a cat when you encounter one. Breathe
        deeply and sit upright. </p>

    <p>Slowly, we are approaching the core.</p>

    <p><strong><em>F. Gratitude is an enemy.</em></strong> </p>

    <p>Gratitude is one of the most important weapons to let complacency take over and it is a sub-element of spiritual
        affairs. Gratitude makes you content with practically everything. Not complaining makes you ignore problems. If
        you get smashed by life, you can be grateful for it as it gave you lessons. If you step on a mine and survive,
        you will be grateful, even if you lose your legs. If you have been deeply traumatized as a child and recover
        fully as an adult and maintain the energy, you can be grateful for having the childhood you had. If you are
        partially sighted and can make out the sun in the sky with the remaining eyelight, you feel some joy. A crippled
        retard will feel joy for solving even the easiest of puzzles and even those, who have a dysfunctional mind will
        be able to smile and appreciate their life. Others instead look at the disabled in pity. A homeless person may
        find joy in finding a bottle in the trash. An infertile couple may be happy if they adopt a damaged child. </p>

    <p>I do not mean to ridicule those people and neither do I wish them any harm, sometimes life hits hard, even if
        most of it is their fault. It's just to prove that, indeed, you can make yourself happy with anything. And
        happiness is a choice. Look, if you lie in bed and are a hair away from turning off the alarm and continuing to
        sleep, and think to yourself: 'I'm grateful for my warm bed. I'm grateful for safety and for a roof above my
        head, I'm grateful for peace in my country, I'm grateful for …' - Aren't you hypnotizing yourself to continue
        sleeping, even at the moment you know that something needs to be done? </p>

    <p>This paragraph is weird. Not being grateful can go as far as becoming depressed and killing oneself. If life is
        meaningless and it is better never to have been, what live for? If one ignores gratitude for the simplest of
        things, one is unable to continue living. So, if being ungrateful is deadly, what should one do? It's
        complicated. Gratitude is vital. Do not forget that. Your brain will bully you if you aren't grateful. </p>

    <p><em>“Nothing is granted; therefore, everything carries meaning. Don't be hesitant to express gratitude. One
            simple step to living a meaningful is a notebook to write down the things you are grateful for. From a
            scientific, philosophical, religious, or spiritual perspective that's how you enjoy life, that's the main
            weapon against depression, decadence, and nihilism. Life is simple and we insist on making it complicated,
            Confucious said. Most of the time of the universe's existence you will be dead. Enjoy the blink of an eye
            called life. Don't enjoy it too much, this blink is too short to be a hedonist. True, the universe will
            continue without you, the rivers will flow and the sun will shine, but be grateful they do. Remember that
            you will die, memento mori.” - #121</em></p>

    <p>Yet still, gratitude creates complacency. Complacency creates severe health problems. Health problems, in turn,
        create unhappiness. Unhappiness creates change. Change creates progress. Progress creates gratitude. It's a
        circle one can't escape easily. But this text isn't a complaint. It's a guide, and I found something that works
        perfectly. This is what made me change my mind about growing up fundamentally. To overcome complacency, </p>

    <p><strong>Look at things you hate. Train yourself to feel disgust, annoyance, and resentment. Every day, visualize
            how much you hate the world and how much you wish to demolish everything. Visualize where your life is
            heading if you don't adjust. Look at how much you hate your weakness. Pay attention to what you are lacking.
            If you hate enough, you will change and find a reason to get out of bed. </strong></p>

    <p>I hate that I don't have a hot blonde girl. I'm angry that I can't do 50 pullups anymore. I hate that will be
        going to go to university and waste my time there. I'm in despair that the tap water halves my health and I
        don't have any other option. I despise that I can't run a marathon. I hate that everyone around me is weak. I'm
        frustrated to waste my time at school. I get pissed when I succumb to hedonism. I'm angry about being unable to
        resist music and listening to music for 5 hours a day despite once being able to withstand it for 3 months. I
        refuse to accept that I have no money or status. I am disgusted that getting older slows down progress. I'm
        annoyed that the unconsciousness of the people around me is when I talk to them and I loathe my mental absence
        at times. I detest that society makes people weak. I hate that climate change ruins the future. I feel fury when
        everyone tries to hijack my attention and time, and I'm no peasant. I hate being a coward. I hate that I'm too
        weak to write a diary. I'm furious that my room is full of plastics. I abhor that I'm unable to maintain
        hardcore discipline. I resent that I ate 100g of chocolate in the past 3 days. I hate that I mismanage my time
        despite knowing that I used to be able to manage it effectively. I hate to listen to others, their advice makes
        me depressed. I despise being weak. Do the modern world's temptations not enslave you too? </p>

    <p>Don't use soft words. Don't say “I wish to improve” or “I want to fix that”. Make it clear to yourself that you
        are offended by your actions and weakness. Make sure your brain sees the problems to figure out solutions
        automatically. If you train yourself to look at problems, you will be able to get out of bed and defeat
        complacency. You need problems to live, without problems, you become complacent. If you hate how you are
        currently living, you will be able to change. If you are honest about your problems, you get a starting point.
        Certainly, I could say to myself that I'm not a coward and have plenty of evidence to prove my point, but still,
        I know that I sort of am. If I hate being a coward, I can fix it, not if I deluded myself. </p>

    <p>Do you want to be grateful and stagnate at your current level? Do you want to stop growing and just give up on
        life? I doubt it. You have not reached peak performance. Rejecting modern comforts, turning away from bad
        influences, and rejecting excessive spirituality help to overcome complacency, but it is only looking at
        problems that makes the true difference because it gives the why and the others give the how. </p>

    <p>You can combine gratitude practices and dissatisfaction practices. Look at things you hate in the morning and
        look at the things you are grateful for in the evening. Get the best out of both worlds. No matter how
        successful you get, there will always be things to hate and a reason to get out of bed. If you train yourself to
        be grateful, calming thoughts will emerge frequently, if you train to view problems, motivating thoughts will
        surface. </p>

    <p><strong><em>G. Success</em></strong> </p>

    <p>That's precisely what my story demonstrated. With enough desire to change, progress is fast, and when problems
        disappear, complacency starts. Certainly, you could wait for complacency to get painful enough, and then use the
        pain to improve, but then your life would be in an draining zig zag. Reaching your ideal life is what makes you
        complacent. That's what I learned the hard way. Yet, I was able to overcome it by generating enough resentment
        by simply looking at the things I hate. I also realized that many things started to work against me, for
        example, talking to the wrong people, becoming older, being artificially busy, instant gratification/modern
        lifestyle, spirituality, and gratitude. </p>

    <h1>5. Time to be extraordinary</h1>

    <p><strong><em>What I mean by peasant.</em></strong> I like peasants. While peasants are often the sort of bad
        example, I appreciate them. Many of them are smarter than someone who studied philosophy for three decades. I
        know some peasants and they are very relaxed, when one drives by in a tractor and I walk on this street, I wave
        and smile. Peasant in the context of every text of mine refers to people, not who work on a farm, but those who
        do not even have the intention to become someone like Napolean. There are the common people, peasants, and those
        who rise above and risk it all. Some people react, and a few people create. Meaning, that even the teacher
        qualifies as a proletarian, a peasant. That's the simplest definition of whether one is a peasant. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Pragmatism for real.</em></strong> If you already set up your life and are already, say forty, you
        can spend your remaining forty years doing sports and reading. You can start a new project where you push hard.
        Nothing is holding you back, there is no reason to be complacent. If your mind limits you, stop thinking, do
        some pushups and sit upright! </p>

    <p><strong><em>If you have nothing do.</em></strong> Recording a 10-minute video takes 30 minutes, hence, there is a
        lot of free time surrounding it. Let's say you have too much free time. Read and do sports, and go on
        adventures. Simple. Took me a couple of months to figure it out. </p>

    <p><strong><em>What is success?</em></strong> Is success losing your passion and being forced to work at some random
        nonsense since your material success started to haunt you, and your company grew big? Can it be called success
        when <em>your children don't love you</em> as you are never home and instead work to 'provide for the family'
        despite their material well-being seeing no change? Certainly, this can hardly be called success. This is
        sickness. Nonetheless, we should not think so deeply; there is a difference between excessive success and not
        feeling reason enough to get out of bed. When you are young, do not worry about family, worry about getting
        rich! Do not mess up the orders; first, get rich, then get a family, then become spiritual. It doesn't work in
        any other order, it's as simple as that. These deep questions about life, you should ask yourself when you have
        figured out how to live. Some cute 'challenging the standard notion of success' is entirely meaningless until
        you have been able to progress far enough. There is no point in wondering what success is for when you are still
        at the very beginning, or sharper phrased - bottom. Do not think, that you do not need success to be happy. I
        doubt you want a life where you keep thinking unproductive thoughts and are a bit depressed on the side. </p>

    <p><strong><em>I never said I didn't want to become rich.</em></strong> I'm direct in my writing. 3 months ago, I
        wrote a text, “Your Children Don't Love You”. This is one of the texts that strongly advocate for a spiritual
        life and critique this pragmatic way of life of constantly doing things and being indifferent to matters of the
        spirit. By the way, this text massively improved my family dynamics. Yet, even in those spiritual texts, I said
        that I need to become rich until I can say, 'I have plentiful my cup runneth over' and only then focus on other
        areas. People thought that I was contradicting myself by claiming that I'm not materialistic - in the sense of
        supercars and other nonsense - while desiring riches. To phrase my response for the context of this text,
        success is more than money. Success is mainly the result of enough days where you have reason to jump out of
        bed. The alternative is a life at the threshold of being unworthy of living, one where you decline in every
        area. Sorry, but this life of averageness and being a normal kid made me depressed, and will continue to do so.
        I tried to eat chocolate and it made me sick and weak. I tried what people told me and when I listened my life
        deteriorated every time. The first lesson as a man is not to chop some wood in the garden with an axe, but
        rather; when you know that you are right, stand for it. Don't ever try to tell me to slow down. Recently,
        several people propagated to me that I should study philosophy and become a philosopher since I developed a
        distaste for math, computers, and other nonsense. You know what, I seriously considered this option. But then, I
        realized, I live like a philosopher and I think I wrote more inspiring stories when I lived as an entrepreneur.
        To hell with thinking. I work hard and become successful, I learn the lessons and share them. I do, I write. My
        ideal life is not just writing. I can write without having studied philosophy, hence, there is no point. By a
        hair, I prevented a terrible mistake. No wonder that girl didn't want me anymore! I must revert to the goal of
        getting rich and instill in myself the constant question: “How do I get rich?” To hell with philosophy.
        Essentially, this text deconstructs many of the things that have changed since September/October '23. I want
        success, not stagnation. You must be thinking the same if you want to live a prosperous life. </p>

    <p><em>Most people give up. Some people reject everything and turn to spirituality, others reject the spirit and
            focus on the material only. How about the path of the middle and choosing both? </em></p>

    <p><strong><em> Going on walks with a million on the bank is different.</em></strong> Take out your binoculars to
        find future me on a yacht or to go back to the beginning of the text. I proposed, that one can go for walks
        without being rich. You can go fishing with your friends without a yacht, you can listen to music while writing,
        and you need no more than a notebook and a mouse or pencil, a matter of your preferred translation. However,
        what may surprise you is that going for walks while not working hard is effectively useless. It's not fun to
        have nothing to do, to be without pressure, and then to go for a walk. It feels differently if you dedicate two
        hours for a walk then when you have nothing to do, linger around and then decide to go for one. Sitting with a
        guitar and singing Katyusha at a campfire while the sun begins to set with your friends is different if you have
        stories to tell because of the life you've lived, rather than if you've been stagnating. If you were stagnant,
        it's fun, but a lot less, trust me on this one. Sitting with your boys talking about life at the campfire is
        awesome, even better if you have an interesting life. Pleasure without pain is meaningless.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Masculine energy.</em></strong> If you want to be a man, you need a reason to exist, and a reason to
        exist, called purpose, comes from desire which comes from pain or the avoidance thereof. If you want to have a
        meaningful life, pray to get a hard one; do not wish for easy times, wish for God to make you hard. Masculine
        energy is fueled by direction, direction means constantly contradicting one's emotions. Also, it's about
        contradicting the female voices. If you indulge in your emotions, you will get weak and decline as a person. You
        do not want to start weakly and weaken greatly. If you are distanced from your core and energy, you won't be
        living a fulfilling and purposeful life. Every time you want to get weak, remember the people you are letting
        down, remember your scarce time, and remember what you live for. You need hardship to thrive. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Always moving.</em></strong> Something in humans wants us to be doing all the time. As soon as we
        arrive at a goal, it instantly becomes irrelevant and we are ready for the next thing. After hardships comes a
        blissful golden hour, and you come to peace. Then the goal is already forgotten and one wants a new one.
        Everything starts anew. I'm almost done with this text, the moment I publish it I'm going to feel great for five
        minutes and then I'm going to start the next one, with slow and fast progress, with blockades and flows. Just to
        collect ideas, write and proofread, until the next one is done. It's a cycle. Life as a whole is full of cycles.
        In the morning one is born, at night one goes. </p>

    <p><strong><em>The plateau.</em></strong> Strongly related to masculine energy, I want to introduce to you another
        point. Does going on a walk to think over life boost creativity if you do that all day long anyway? No. If you
        are depressed and take a rest day, does the depression go away? No, it doesn't. If you are fat and declining in
        your health, does taking a day off make you slim? Not really. If you haven't been working hard and slowly you
        start to lose your health, memory, cognition, and drive, it's tempting to think that you need a break. In
        two-thirds of the cases, you don't need a break, you need hardship, which sounds counterintuitive. If you are
        full of masculine energy, you can jump over the rest of the paragraph, you know already this phenomenon quite
        well. When you are doing purposeful things and working hard, you feel incredibly energized and healthy. Yet,
        when you live at 20% of your potential, i.e. at your complacent level, you feel tired all the time and think to
        yourself that you need to take things a little easier, while in actuality you need hardship. This is a bit
        abstract, but I think you already know this phenomenon yourself. If you are nowhere close to your edge, you
        start to deteriorate and it's easy to mistake this pain for burnout. I had both kinds of pain and they feel
        identical, the solution for one of those pains is to take a rest day, and for the other one, it's to quit being
        weak. It's natural to feel exhausted if the only things you do are those not worthy of being mentioned. Just as
        with sports, when you do them, you exhaust yourself and are simultaneously much more alive. So, do not mistake
        weakness for a need to rest, it could be quite the contrary, it could be a call for you to work super hard. </p>

    <p><strong><em>The flame.</em></strong> You don't exactly choose to be a peasant or a bourgeois. Mostly your
        environment and other factors dictate. If you weren't born and raised to have intelligence it makes everyone
        look dim when entering the room, you probably are sort of happy with the average life. Happy not in the sense of
        being content and giving up because life isn't painful enough, but rather, because you are happy. The sign at
        your door that says 'home sweet home' makes you feel welcome. If you are truly happy with that, let me shake
        your hands, you've made it. Yet, I fear most people aren't like this, they have a flame inside of them. This
        generates a burning desire to progress. If one is lucky and able to act upon that desire and one gets
        successful, through hard work, the life one lives is beautiful, truly. If one is born with this flame and is
        unable to act upon it and one has to give up, life is looking dark. It's risky to be born with a desiring flame.
        You can get luck and live a much better life than everyone else, or you get unlucky and waste your potential,
        and grow sick with life as you wanted more and were unhappy. Hence, most people try to extinguish their flames.
        However, I dictate, that it is your duty to try to elevate yourself, you can always fall later on, and you must
        not surrender and fall before the battles have been lost. I doubt you desire a life of regret. If you love a
        girl enough and she rejects you multiple times, you will be free of regret, not if you gave up at the zeroth
        try. If she or life, rejects you, at least you tried and can come to peace. A life free of regret means you try
        everything in your power to make sure nothing exists that can be regretted.</p>

    <p><em>Initially, I thought I changed and matured - like everyone wanted me to. Now I ridicule those who
            extinguished their flame. I'm not putting off my flame, I'm adding more material.</em></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
    <p>One final thought. How would you live if your exact life was repeated infinitely many times? Over and over again,
        exactly your life and everything would be identical. You would not be aware of anything repeating. Such a
        proposal, does it please you? If not, you should perhaps change your life. </p>


        <p><em>You don't want to arrive, meaning comes from moving forward. The journey is the destination. Life is meant to be lived in motion.</em></p>
