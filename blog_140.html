    <p><em>“Tomorrow, many of us will see each other for the last time. Everyone will go their own way, and that's a
            good thing. They say nothing in life is permanent except change. School is now a closed chapter, and what
            remains are sweet memories. I want to thank you very much and say goodbye. I wish you all the best.” </em> –
        33 heart reactions, by far the most reactions to a single message in our 12th-grade group chat</p>

    <p><em>“Please write a book with positive affirmations one day.”</em></p>

    <p><em>“<strong>Uncompromising excellence in any realm of human endeavor is a true testament to the indomitability
                of my spirit.</strong> I recommend this affirmation. It occurred to me a few days ago and is now the
            guiding principle of my blog. […] Thank you very much for the compliment.”</em></p>

    <p>Yesterday, I wrote in the group chat and was recognized as the highest-status student I ought to be. I know of
        only one person who can say the things I proclaim without losing credibility. </p>

    <p>Today, I saw many of my classmates for the very last time. We had a school report ceremony today. School is a
        closed chapter. Am I sad? No. Do I have regrets? No. Do I fear the future? No. Everything that happened did so
        for a reason. </p>

    <p>This text is me looking back on 11 years of school. 11 years because I skipped 9th grade.</p>

    <p>The best place to start is at the beginning. School wasn’t always fun; in fact, for the first ten years, until
        the end of 11th grade, it was horrible. In primary school, I got bullied, and years later, I bullied. That’s no
        fun. I had a negative status for a very long time. No one liked me; I despised everyone as well. I had some
        <em>mildly</em> toxic traits, and that made my life suck as a whole. For example, I had a <em>light</em>
        superiority complex.
    </p>

    <p>Then, I started to develop myself at the age of 13. At 15, in December 2022, I began considering becoming social
        because plenty of the ice in my soul melted. Yet, the school still sucked; I had no social skills, and I still
        had many toxic traits. Everyone understands very well that school is only enjoyable with friends. No one knew
        me; I knew no one. </p>

    <p>In March 2023, at 15 and in 11th grade, I got a crush on a girl, the fifth one in my life. My social skills have
        improved massively because of extra motivation. For example, I started to think of compliments for each
        classmate. I got rejected in June and later on a second time, and it hurt for a year until June 2024, after the
        end of 12th grade. Her rejections massively bettered my character, for example, removing my strengthening
        empathy and completely eliminating arrogance, among other positives.</p>

    <p>Jumping back to the beginning of 12th grade, some started to notice me slowly. After the summer holidays, I could
        feel people noticing how hardcore I’ve been living. They felt the energy I gave off after no music, sweets, or
        warm water for three months straight. I started gaining recognition for multiple things, for example, for an
        indomitable spirit in gym class, my extraordinary humor, the questions I asked everyone, the dips and pushups I
        did in the breaks, the genuinely amazing videos and photos I created of the trips we had, for skipping 9th
        grade, for getting up at three, for my confidence and authenticity, for being very passionate, fast and
        energetic in everything I did and so on… Everyone also knew I was among the best students of all time; for
        example, in 12th grade, I had 12 consecutive 1+, working during the lessons and being the most attentive and
        brightest student many teachers have seen in decades. Multiple teachers told me I had reached a legendary status
        level amongst the younger grades. Slowly, all of that started to add, and I finally became the highest-status
        student, which everyone saw at prom and even more at the ceremony. </p>

    <p>Meanwhile, I didn’t care much about school. I knew my vision did not require learning the quadratic equation, so
        I was indifferent to its lessons. Only later on I started to care about the people at school. The quadratic
        equation is, by the way, the only thing I found to be missing from skipping 9th grade. I never did anything for
        school; I programmed, wrote, meditated, or edited photos. I skipped 9th grade because I wanted to get school
        done faster. That was one of the best decisions of my life. I hardly studied and only sometimes completed
        homework. I didn’t care and focused on my stuff. And still, I was seen as the brightest and most attentive
        student in my school.</p>

    <p>In short, school sucked for a decade, and I managed to turn everything around while focusing on myself rather
        than the lessons. I managed to transition from negative status to having, by far, the highest status among my
        peers. </p>

    <p>Today, at the school report ceremony, everyone recognized my status. I stress that because I had concluded a year
        ago that I'm the sexiest person in my town of 25.000 people, and believing that made me act such that it came
        true. I also stress that because, for a decade, I had a negative and low status. I got many awards, but that’s
        not all. I managed to be funny by buttoning my suit after going to the front, almost striptease, right? I walked
        with pride, not by looking at the ground. I’m the only person who ran to their mother after getting flowers to
        gift them to her. I’m a professional. I thanked this girl for indirectly accelerating my development. I thanked
        my teachers, and I thanked my friends. I dared to express confidence, competence, and gratitude. </p>

    <p>Then, I told that girl, ‘In 20 years I'm a billionaire’. If not billionaire, then millionaire. Now I’ve said it.
        I must do it because I'm not a liar. Now, I have no option but to become massively successful. I just have to.
        Sometimes in life, you throw dice, and it has to land at six, no matter the laws of the universe. </p>

    <p><em>“If you stay in the group chat, organizing a reunion in 2044 will be easier. Some people, like me, have
            things to prove, so the reunion is a huge priority. Until then, farewell!” </em>– me in the group chat again
    </p>

    <p>Was school a success for me? Was not getting the girl I wanted a success? No. Was it a success to finish Abitur
        with 1.0 a year faster without trying? Was it successful to go from negative status to the highest status among
        my peers in a mere year? Was massive positive character development success? Yes.</p>

    <p>School may have been unenjoyable for 10 out of 11 years, but in the end, I went out not only victoriously but at
        the very top. Socially, academically, physically, and spiritually, … Thus I conclude, </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Uncompromising excellence<br>
            in any realm of human endeavor<br>
            is a true testament to the indomitability<br>
            of my spirit.</em>
