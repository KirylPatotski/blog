    <h1>Atheism doesn't exist</h1>

    <p>Today I was a rest day, - those are rare in my life and I don't rest like a normal person either. Today I went on
        a 21-kilometer walk, at first out of the town, then through the countryside, and finally through the forested
        mountains, where I aimed to find a specific ruin to photograph. I found it made me on my way back after I had
        already walked for 3 hours. At that time, I didn't encounter a single person except a few motorcycles, bikes, or
        cars passing by at high speed and only focusing on the road, as they should. That means, for a while, I have
        been isolated as there were no other people walking through the forest. It was already 17 o'clock, and the sun
        was already creating a golden atmosphere it was warm, there were no clouds and it was quiet. On my way home I
        tried to do something. I tried to interrupt the silence and tried to press some words out of my mouth. - I
        couldn't. Maybe I was just too scared of the step-like noises from the bushes behind me or maybe it would be too
        “awkward” to say something if you were alone. <em>Awkwardness when alone?</em></p>

    <p>To make this scenario even more engaging, dear reader, try this thought experiment. Other people may still be
        watching in the forest, also if you don't spot them and the fear of wild animals is a legitimate concern too.
        Now, let's use another situation, one where there wouldn't even be a chance to encounter other people and
        animals. This thought construction materializes if you sail alone. There would be nothing except the water, the
        boat, and yourself. Now scream a curse word. Even in your thought experiment you most likely would not do it,
        unless I specifically challenge you too. Still, in the forest scenario, I didn't even dare to squeak out a
        noise. That's not too different from the boat scenario if you think about it.</p>

    <p>Your mind simply isn't built to be an atheist, believing in nothing. Because no normal person would make a noise
        either. You know and live with the knowledge, assumption, or <em>belief</em> that someone else is always watching, even
        if that's just you. </p>

    <p>I wasn't religious my whole life either. I was raised to be an Orthodox Christian but I didn't care about it very
        much. As I became a teenager, around the age of 12-14 I didn't pray, I tried to live “on my own” - do you think
        it made my life better? No. It was a mistake. Prayers do make your life significantly better; they remove
        worries and insecurities on a level that only mediation is able to provide. I can't <em>believe</em> I used to not pray
        and not mediate. My mind and progress were accordingly messed up. It simply isn't enough to pretend you don't
        need God, and even worse if you think you need ideology instead. Fortunately, I turned back to God and it
        improved my life a lot.</p>

    <p>If you look at a statistic about the amount of religious people and the amount of wealth in a country, you will
        see that atheism is most common in richer countries. It's easy to find a reason why. “What do you need God for
        if you have a Tesla” - It's materialism. Let me warn you materialism will end you. Every rich singer, actor, or
        athlete either turns to promiscuity or to materialism and declines rapidly. Religion can prevent that. How can
        you desire a new car instead of enlightenment or promiscuity instead of a healthy relationship if God is
        constantly watching and there to help? The ones not declining prioritize their mind and their <em>beliefs</em> instead.
    </p>

    <p>It doesn't mean that you need to become a Christian right away, it takes time. But atheism will bring you
        nowhere, as there has to be something filling your mind and I hope you choose religion over materialism. It also
        doesn't mean that you need to go to church every day, religion happens in your mind!</p>
