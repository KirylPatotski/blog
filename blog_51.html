    <h1>You deserve it</h1>

    <p>It was April 2023 and I was writing essays every day because I got started with YouTube at that time. I most of
        the texts I wrote were very straightforward because they were designed as scripts for me to speak through the
        camera. I knew at that time, that my 2 most significant texts would solve the biggest problems for most people:
        bad habits (especially phone usage) and meaninglessness. I have already written both of them, 20 handwritten
        pages, even though most of my texts at that time never surpassed 400 words. As I wrote a text about phone
        addiction, I dug very deep into myself, my past, and my future if I wouldn't fix everything. At this time, I
        already had the beliefs of my text “The only way to Live”, which were essentially reaching your limits, never
        stopping, and minimizing regret. So, I wrote the text and then, estimated how much time I have spent on my phone
        during my past years. </p>

    <p>I estimated that I spent 8000 hours of my life on my phone. Over the span of 5 years, 4 hours a day. There are
        8760 hours in one year - I have wasted one year of my youth, of my most valuable years. It takes 10 000 hours to
        become world-class at something, yet I have wasted my time, in an unproductive and even destructive way. Instead
        of developing myself, I wasted my potential. There are no upsides to phone usage, it's only neutral in the best
        case and destructive in the worst case. Phone usage damages your health, posture, time management, and
        productivity, and corrupts your mind. Also, it removes any desire to do anything, which in turn means, that
        higher forms of pleasure, those that include work and effort will be forever out of reach from you - you simply
        accomplish nothing in your life. </p>

    <p>I did not “waste” my time on my phone because I watched “science and education” videos. But I can tell you,
        that's completely useless. Read instead, and if you start reading, you will notice, that using your phone and
        the internet had a benefit of zero. That means, saying you got “educated” with YouTube is an excuse or a lie.
    </p>

    <p>As I calculated my wasted time, I have never touched my phone again to waste time. The pain of all the wasted
        time and potential as well as of the direct negative consequences was too great. <em>I have had enough</em>.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>I see everyone else around me on their phone constantly, which is a massive problem. If I sit at the train
        station it's not rare that I am the only person who is not on his phone but rather simply looks around (and I am
        definitely the only one with a notebook in my hands or computer in my hands while standing). Using your phone
        creates great damage to your mind. Most people are unable to focus to a point where some can be perceived as
        requiring a lot of help from a professional. It's very easy to see if someone is present in a conversation or
        simply mentally offline, in 90% of cases the people aren't even able to hold eye contact. Because phones
        constantly stimulate, they remove the ability to think, too, because they remove the incentive and capabilities
        to do so at the same time. Because thinking takes effort, not thinking is the default position, at the same time
        a position that will not bring you anywhere. </p>

    <p>Even if you didn't try to work so hard, you would still outcompete 99% of people, if you don't have any bad
        habits. Let's suppose you don't waste time, then you won't have any alternative to being productive, compared to
        everyone else. You need to consider that if everyone else gets compounded negative consequences, you will move
        to the top automatically if you value yourself and take responsibility. Other people don't want to be saved; you
        can only save yourself. If you are ok slowing down and reversing your trajectory by simply indulging in
        stimulation, fine, you deserve the consequences. The consequences get worse over time and the rewards get better
        over time, so why don't choose which one you want? </p>

    <p>Maybe you are not ready to choose, maybe you will only choose when it is already too late and your fate hits you
        hard enough, providing a 180° turn - it takes one night to question everything and to decide “I have had
        enough”. When your fate hits you hard enough and you will be willing to change, you will feel regret and this
        regret will never go away. You could argue that you saved yourself as soon as possible, but the regret will
        never go away, because it is a warning. Never waste your life again.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>No, you don't need your phone for more than 20 minutes a day either.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>I know that it's very hard to quit an addiction one has had for a very long time, ultimately it will take a very
        long time for you too and I have already written a text on how to fix your life, if you have not read it, here
        is the <a href='blog_5.html'>link</a>. The blog on how to get rid of phone usage will only release in a few
        months.</p>

        <p>Good luck.</p>
