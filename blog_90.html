    <h1>Catharsis</h1>

    <p>This text will explain, how I handled a heartbreak twice.</p>

    <p><em><strong> Notes from 26.10.2023, Thursday¹</em></strong></p>

    <p>I am going through heartbreak right now, like a few months ago. As a result, I cut out every input, whether it's
        reading, music, the computer, or my phone. I have already done that multiple times and my life changed forever
        and you could see the results of the most recent period: this blog. I don't know what's going to happen if I
        stop any input until 9.11.2023. These 2 weeks will be of absolute discipline, on a level only achievable after a
        few years of experience. I need discipline to rest and to recover again and to come out stronger. I will have a
        lot of fun with my notebook, fixing the problems I'm facing and improving further. </p>

    <p>I will need to improve on the biggest and last standing problem as it is currently one of 2 remaining, while the
        second one is a minor improvement. In the text “The Only Way to Live” I have marked a point holding people, and
        specifically me back. Coldness, arrogance, and categoric stubbornness. I couldn't fix it because I felt it to be
        useful and until 2023 it served me well, now that's over and I don't know how to fix it. I will find out on my
        own by removing any distractions. I will also need to find a new purpose, since my last one, my apps, ended in
        September which is my first app. The second problem I will need to face is permanent discipline. After living
        perfectly disciplined from 2.4.2023 to 22.5.2023 and then from 14.6.2023 to 8.9.2023 I slipped back from that,
        including now. I can tell for certain, that being disciplined and going through heartbreak feels better being
        loved and having bad habits. Still don't know for sure, how to never slip back again. </p>

    <p>At 15:47:39 I listened to the last song and turned off my computer as well as my phone and deleted any
        communication apps. </p>


    <p><em><strong>Notes from 28.10.2023 and 29.10.2023, Saturday and Sunday³</em></strong></p>

    <h1>1. Being in love and purpose</h1>

    <p>Purpose is a vision that occupies your mind both conscious and subconscious. It gives your life meaning and is
        something you work and live for. It gives you a lot of energy and perspective. I was able to achieve massive
        results with app development when that used to be my <a href="blog_87.html">purpose</a>. I aligned my life to it and worked on it and
        thought about it all day long, to a point where I wouldn't even make my hair, metaphorically and literally. It
        gave me strength and discipline. Then, I got a new thing to get my #1 spot in my mind, a girl, so that became my
        new purpose. I knew, that as long as it would occupy me, direct progress would be hindered on other purposes
        since one has to be fulfilled at a time. I asked her out in mid-June. Mid-June 2023 is similar to now because I
        had an amazing disciplined intense work period for 2 months already and got naturally weaker. I asked her out
        and got rejected and it never got resolved since then. The months went by and life went on, with her in my mind.
        Yet, at this time, when I got weaker after an amazing time and with a painful long-lasting rejection, I used
        this momentum of pain to start a new micro-chapter. I would do simply nothing, (nothing, just lying in bed and
        staring at the ceiling) and this text is about the power of doing that because I started to feel again as if my
        heart was broken 4 months later too.</p>

    <h1>2. Voluntary burnout</h1>

    <p>I continuously remind you, to think in 10-year intervals into the future and to delay gratification, to
        sacrifice, and to genuinely try your best at everything you do… How about you get rid of the delayed
        gratification as well, meaning you free yourself from constraining draining expectations of gratification
        altogether? For many times over, I had more or less long periods where I had no gratification at all. The only
        pleasure I was getting was lying in my quiet clean room and looking at the ceiling. I was happy.</p>

    <p>For the next few weeks or months, I will dispose of anything spiking the motivation neurotransmitter dopamine or
        anything constituting excessive comfort. I got rid of sweets, sugar, tea, warm water, music,
        light, books, reading, WhatsApp, YouTube videos, and any form of pleasure, stimulation, or input in general.
        This was combined with discipline only seen in prisons or the military.</p>

    <p>After doing it for 2 days, I felt great again. The state of existence alters fully, every moment is present which
        creates happiness. It's hard to describe how that feels, however, some approximate this feeling. If you are
        about to fall asleep and hear a loud noise, this noise feels different than it would during the day, right? It
        feels less grey, rather it feels as if that noise goes through your entire consciousness and it's insanely loud.
        The same applies to vision, where you start to notice details, you would never notice even when looking at them
        with intent. The world starts to feel like a cinematic moment in a movie. It becomes possible to get your
        attention span to 10 minutes effortlessly. Yesterday, Friday 27.10.2023, I stood at a small dynamic stream for
        10 minutes and thought about nothing. I have trained myself <a href="blog_88.html">not to think</a> about
        anything for a long time. That
        means, your whole life starts to feel as if you have just woken up hungry with full presence, deep breath, an
        erect posture, and no thoughts. Give your mind time to sort and process things.</p>

    <p>The first time I tried to do something similar was in December 2022 or January 2023, where for 2 weeks I would
        resist any pleasure and input altogether. This was trendy at that time on social media and it was called
        “Dopamine detox” I did that and got the benefits of it. Even if you aren't going through anything right now, I
        would recommend such a minimalist disciplined time as well. The first time I used this to reset my baseline to
        get rid of bad habits. I slipped back later and in April, I watched my last YouTube video and took my last warm
        shower. I had an amazing time with immense productivity until mid-June when this first period of uninterrupted
        productivity and mental sharpness ended naturally. Then in June, after a while, I was ready for the next period
        with greater discipline. I would not only stop to watch YouTube for example, but I would also stop listening to
        music for instance. For approximately 10 days I had discipline never seen before, and I kept this input-free
        period until central September 2023, except for reading. This created great results: this blog along with other
        things. As a side effect, working gets fun again, especially the hard work!</p>

    <p>Now my thoughts are free again and what's going to happen?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <h1>3. Heartbreak?</h1>

    <p>I started with absolute discipline again, after having lost it in the end days of September after maintaining
        extreme uninterrupted discipline for 3 months, with a period of no input, and even higher discipline, just as
        now. As I decided on Thursday the 26th of October to restart such a period, I felt suddenly blissful again. I
        took control of my mind and life to an extreme level again. I felt free, as a result of discipline. Discipline
        creates freedom because it allows you to free yourself from any desires and external conditions. You don't feel
        like getting up at 5? Well, now that you are in pain, you don't bother considering alternatives. I missed
        extreme discipline a lot, I realized how much I suffered without it.</p>

    <p>I had a lot of time to reflect because I refused weakness and stimulation… Just a few hours after deciding to
        change, which was still on Thursday, I noticed something. There was no reason to be sad and no reason to think
        that my heart was broken. I still have an interest in her, I'm well aware that I could embarrass⁴ myself by
        writing so, but everything else would be inauthentic! I missed extreme discipline and strength and thought less
        about myself. That's because God was disappointed in my weakness and punished me with impressions I didn't like.
        Yes, reality is a projection of the mind. Heartbreak is weakness, turns out, you can overcome it with
        discipline.</p>

    <p>I wouldn't dare to look up on the internet how to rid of a crush and it doesn't matter what it would have said,
        because you need to simply live on your sustainable edge, just as I do, and be strong. Looking up tips or
        talking with someone about it isn't something I would ever advise, because change has to come from within to be
        sustainable. My grandmother would have advised me to watch a movie, such as “Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears”
        And let's say I would have stimulated and distracted myself with it, after all the goal of these timeless movies
        is catharsis, the cleaning of the soul so to speak. Isn't stimulation the exact opposite of what I'm doing right
        now and what I'm finding healthy? If I got rid of that love, it would make my life a lot emptier and I don't
        think it would have been possible in the first place. I trained myself <a href="blog_88.html">not to think</a>
        about her and I succeeded. I stopped thinking about her but by no means did she leave my mind, turns out, love
        isn't <a href="blog_63.html">trauma</a> that can be resolved. That's purpose and it will occupy your mind, if not suppressed by
        distractions. I got rid of any distractions, pleasure, input, and stimulations and still thought about her. My
        recent text tells another story, but that's because of the way every text of mine is written, before the event²
    </p>

    <p>What else did I envision while refusing input? Nothing new, a vision kept coming back, which I already had in the
        summer. I want to get up at 3:30 to go into the mountains and record YouTube videos, every day. Unfortunately,
        that's too late, since it's too dark for the footage to be of use, I rise before the sun does. </p>

    <h1>4. Monk mode</h1>

    <p>This life, which I'm living for the next few weeks or months is called <a href="blog_12.html">monk mode</a>. It's something everyone must go
        through to learn what's authentic and what isn't. I rest with discipline and not with instant gratification. I
        indulged in instant gratification and bad habits such as sugar in late September and <a href="blog_85.html">suffered extensively</a> as a
        result. I got susceptible to weakness because <a href="blog_87.html">purpose</a> resolved itself, and my first <a href="blog_64.html">app failed</a>.</p>

    <p>I have mentioned 2 problems that I'm trying to resolve at the beginning of this text. The first problem of
        arrogance starts with formulating more carefully and I accelerated the implementation with lightning speed and
        with atom-splitting precision. I will get more practice. The second problem may be unresolvable.</p>

    <p>Spirituality and minimalism aren't about owning less and only owning things that add value to your life. It's
        about freeing yourself from the expectations of materialism. The first lesson in Buddhism goes the following.
        You have a black plane and a white power, such as salt. With enough time and persistent effort, you can create a
        beautiful eye-pleasing pattern in the form of a circle and fractals. When you feel as if the work has been done,
        you throw your work and destroy pride in the process, freeing yourself. At the moment of greatest pride in your
        work, it gets destroyed and something new shall be crafted from it. Every person has something you can pressure
        them with. Some people are docile on a scale unimaginable to me. Their parents threaten them with confiscation
        of their electronic devices for instance, adults can be pressured with the exposure of their secrets and they
        submit. Over the span of 3 years, I have built enough mental strength to have nothing able to put pressure on me
        in the material realm. Take away everything I possess and I will find happiness regardless. </p>

    <p>If you know me in real life, there is another story that needs to be told. On 2.6.2023, which was already in the
        decline from an amazing time, maybe even the peak, someone sent me a short story. I read it and the phrase that
        stuck was: “If you have a box of pears and always sacrifice the best pears for later, you may never eat a tasty
        sweet ripe pear.” I doubted if I had lived right for the last 2.5 years at that time since I never did anything
        “fun” Then in September on the trip to Venice I got susceptible to a similar phrase again. A few months had
        passed since and now I know better: if you eat a tasty sweet ripe pear, you will notice that it was better in
        your imagination. The phases of hard work are the reward, not some indoctrinated inauthentic “vacation” The
        beauty of monk mode is that it allows this work period to be replaced by productive and authentic rest, by
        removing any stimuli, input, and distractions. It leaves just your mind together with yourself and allows for
        everything to be figured out. Let me give you another insight from experience. Let's say you haven't eaten sugar
        in years and taste your first bite of chocolate again. It won't make fun, it will hurt because you
        underestimated the concentration of sugar and it will hurt mentally even more because weakness overthrew you.
    </p>

    <p>Here is another perspective on this whole situation. Why do you fall in love, argue for nothing, procrastinate,
        and create problems seemingly out of nowhere? To create meaning, otherwise, everything is indifferent. That's
        not the right path. By refusing any external things to influence yourself, you can still create meaning and
        purpose, but only if you have been living authentically. A person who numbs themselves with instant
        gratification needs those things like conflicts to create action, at the same time, other people can be happy
        with nothing. If you took everything away from a social media addict for instance, they would suffer, on
        contrast, if you took away everything from a person who has been working on themselves for years, this second
        person would be happy without anything. Meaning should never be allowed to stem from the material realm. The
        choice is yours. </p>

    <p>Now, take a deep breath and I'm gone again, no one is going to spot me and no one is going to hear my thoughts,
        only I will listen and learn from them. After all, why is it getting relevant exactly now? Then I will return
        with greater lessons learned and remember to trust the process and God. </p>

    <p>¹ These notes have been modified to make sense in the context of this text, otherwise, there would have been
        redundancies.</p>

    <p>² How every text of mine is written: I look into the future and sense change, these texts are therefore a priori,
        meaning thought through before the actual events. As soon as that vision happens, I write the text and most of
        the time, it takes a few weeks or months for the change to happen and these predictions turn out to be correct
        around 90% of the time. In this case, my prediction was already disproved five days later.</p>

    <p>³ The paragraph that goes: “If you know me in real life…” was written on Sunday.</p>

    <p>⁴ In front of whom? If you read it years later, you certainly won't start to hate me for it, authenticity will
        rather do the opposite. I don't know if she reads these blogs, if she does, then this blog will help and if not,
        it doesn't matter anyway. Deleting texts would be inauthentic. If nothing works out, I can still admit being
        wrong, but then the previous text would be right. But the clock is ticking, I'm only going to see her around 25
        times.</p>
