    <h1>Easy path through life</h1>

    <p>In my household two dogs reside. One dog has been part of our household for 1 year while the
        other one has only been for a few months. Whenever I would eat something, both dogs would approach me, begging
        to get some food. Every time, I hold the food just above their reach, so that the dogs have to jump multiple
        times to get the food. This has the advantage, that the food will be perceived of higher value and better taste
        because the dogs needed to sacrifice and work in order to acquire it. But not both dogs are equal: one dog tries
        its best every time while the other one stops 1.5 cm before the finish line. That means the second dog hopes
        that I not only lower the barrier - but remove it completely. </p>

    <p>Unfortunately, some people also live their life in a constant mode of taking the easy path, but the problem is
        that there is no such thing as an easy path through life that is also desirable at the moment as well as in the
        long term. Every time the second dog fails to reach its desired food, the dog gets weaker mentally and someday
        stops even trying. Contrary to what you might assume, this is not caused by too large challenges, because if the
        dog already touched the food with its nose for a brief moment in the air, the dog will surely be able to try
        again a bit more - but no, the dog simply quits and becomes a loser, picking the easy path. </p>

    <p>In humans, you can see the easy path all the time. Why should you go to school when you can fake being sick? Why
        should you try to think, if you can pretend to be mentally retarded and relax in the meantime? Why even try to
        lose weight if you can say it's a disease? Every time someone picks the easy path, they get weaker. The second
        dog would have already died, if it didn't try its absolute best and lived in nature, because in the long run,
        the dog that tries its absolute best wins because every win makes it mentally stronger. Over the years, these
        subtle differences make a drastic change. It didn't matter initially, because the second dog was a puppy, but
        the dog's mindset stays weak for the rest of its life. </p>


    <p>Also, since you do one thing just as every other, do you think that the dog that constantly gives up will try as
        hard as the other dog when it comes to a fight? The weaker ones are simply living their life hoping that no
        threat will ever occur and the stronger ones become the threat themselves or have the capacity to handle hard
        times. Think long-term and stay strong.</p>

    <p>Appendix: No, not right</p>

    <p>One might point out that the weaker dog is significantly younger than the other one. But I disagree, because the
        mindset stays the same, and if one gets used to weakness, it's likely that it will be kept for the rest of one's
        life. I don't expect both dogs to jump equally high, of course, but weakness is easier to maintain than
        strength. Even 6-year-old kids can give up or stay competitive, even if that's not totally relevant or visible
        in their context, but even kids can fake being sick, for example, to avoid school, the hard path through life.
        Only when they get older, do their life trajectories start to differ significantly.</p>
