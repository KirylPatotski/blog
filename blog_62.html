    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Implement your ideas the same day</span></h1>

    <h1>Move faster, get further</h1>

    <p>Here is how I started with blogging. In March I started with YouTube and wrote scripts in my notebook, which
        wasn't very optimal. For one, no one except me could read them or access them, and writing manually also removes
        the possibility of editing second, if you write in a notebook, you have to be looking down and sitting, but you
        are able to type on a keyboard faster and while standing upright, because you have to look forward instead of
        down, and also the texts are easier to process and for others to read. In parallel, I failed to create a website
        multiple times at that time and I had an app, that could have used some external content and a YouTube channel
        with directly equivalent content. <em>I found out how to host a website for free on the internet on a Wednesday
            evening and before Thursday noon I wrote 3 blogs and created the website.</em> This is what I would call speed.</p>

    <p>In my life, there are a lot of these stories, for example, on the same day I got the idea for “Math for elders” I
        already started to implement it, without even making a plan. I got started right away and was “done”, which
        means I created a fully functional prototype in just 2 weeks. Another such story was, coincidentally, when I got
        the idea for a website, for my app, which would display a unique math riddle every day (a fail that contributed
        to my <a href="blog_19.html">burnout</a> in June '23). I bought domains on the same day and started to develop this site. Here is another
        one: As soon as I got the idea (another fail that contributed to my burnout) to try AR/VR technology for my app,
        in order to be at the forefront of innovation, I tried it out on the next day, and as it was 6:20, this idea
        already died because of a lack of a modern phone. </p>

    <p>That's what speed means, it means implementing an idea in the same you get it.</p>

    <p>Speed is key</p>

    <p>The first advantage of moving fast is that reduces stress - I think this sounds surprising, because normally
        risk, speed, overwhelmingness, and many other facets of progress are connected with stress. I don't know if this
        point is corrupted by my immense stress tolerance, but I believe that getting something out of your mind reduces
        stress in comparison to thinking about it the entire time. If you think about something, it doesn't mean, that
        you will make progress in that area, it's only when you try it out yourself. If I have only just thought about
        starting a blog for a few days instead of simply doing it, my mind may have come up with countless “reasons” on
        why that's a bad idea, or how exactly I should implement it. But this thinking gets one nowhere because it
        ignores reality and these thoughts only stay true when kept in an illusion. Every time you simply do something,
        there are 2 things that can happen. It's either a complete failure and you stop or you continue to do it, as you
        can see, there is no “you keep thinking about and procrastinate”, because “thinking about it” is
        procrastination, and planning can be procrastination as well. Planning is only useful if the project to start is
        too much above your resources - skill, size, time, or knowledge. In every other case, planning is most likely
        procrastination. I should clarify, that planning your next day is something different than “planning” a next
        blog instead of simply writing it. </p>


    <p>If you move fast, you will get further, that's what an analogy reveals. In this text, “Failures kill” I have
        mentioned an analogy. Every time you make a decision, your life splits, because other options where possible.
        That means, if there are 3 decisions with 2 resulting sub-decisions, there are 6 possible scenarios in this
        case, your life path splits like a tree. That's also the reason, why you need to take radical responsibility.
        This analogy reveals, that if you decide more frequently, you will get further in the tree of life, on the
        contrary, not deciding keeps you stuck. Being stuck is not really the case, because others keep making
        decisions, and so your situation gets worse inevitably. That's also why <em>failures kill</em> because they remove a
        path that was wrong all along. If you get further than everyone else, it will make your life absolutely more
        worth living. Because getting further will make sure you fulfill your life's mission. Getting further will also
        provide you with more valuable things such as memories, lessons, and fulfillment. Speed will make you into a
        high performer.</p>

    <p>Consistency is the foundation</p>

    <p>I think that the concept of consistency is often viewed as the secret of success. Consistency is very important,
        but only if you have already reached a desirable level. For example, in the autumn of 2022, I was only able to
        do 10 pushups. I increased it to 150 pushups per day for around 4 months and got consistent with that amount
        until I started to go to the gym. There would have been no point in “starting low and improving every day”
        because it is easy to make progress in the beginning and consistency only served <em>after</em> I got speed. Don't get
        consistent on a low level, try to reach a high level first and then stay consistent at that level. Let's say I
        got consistent with 10 pushups every day. That would be awesome, but 150 every day consistently would make a
        much better job. </p>

    <p>If you do something all the time something interesting happens: the power of the compound effect. Every tiny
        decision you make adds up and everything has an effect on your future. Eaten sweets? Already done some damage to
        yourself. Completed 10 pushups? Already some progress. That's why it's very important to stay consistent.</p>

    <p>Let's go back to our analogy. If you move fast and consistently, meaning you decide frequently and quickly,
        without procrastination, you will get the furthest, because you are using both systems in your favor.</p>

    <p>Consistency is valuable, if the activity has proven to be effective, and if it has proven to be effective, you
        need to get consistent with it. The only way to find out the effectiveness is with speed, and not with
        procrastination. You should still be careful because often results are only visible after a long time of
        consistency and speed. But some things don't need to get verified, such as reading or doing pushups, as it's
        common sense that these things provide value, especially if done consistently and fast.</p>

    <p>Get consistent with speed and get consistent fast. Like this, you will become unstoppable, because just like
        thinking long term, acting fast is a good habit and a skill that can be practiced. </p>

    <p>The unconventional path</p>

    <p>The result of acting fast and staying consistent with effective measures and dropping failures instead of
        overthinking is the unconventional path. Because your life will change forever after you take risks all the time
        and do it fast - speed magnifies just as consistency.</p>
