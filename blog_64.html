    <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">The Final Battle</span></h1>

     <h1>The necklace - a symbol of progress</h1>
   
    <p>For my whole life, I have been an Orthodox Christian and that's why I have been wearing a metal necklace.
        Unfortunately, I lost this metal necklace already in 3rd grade, in the school's sports lesson, and in that time,
        I got new chains and lost them multiple times. The original chain reappeared in 4th grade, fortunately, but by
        then it was already a bit too small so I got a new chain, this time a simple, temporary rope and I have been
        wearing it for a very long time. However, in 2020 I got a new, longer, metal necklace, but I didn't dare to cut
        the rope open to use the metal chain. That means a new, metal chain has been lying on my desk, and I didn't
        touch it. Until yesterday, the 5th of September of 2023. Yesterday I took my scissors and cut the rope, put it
        in the chest on my desk, removed the cross, and put on the new metal chain, which has been never used and laid
        without a purpose. I cut my rope and moved on from the past symbolically. If I hesitated for years and waited
        for the right moment, what has happened? </p>

        <p><em>My first idea, it's dead</em></p>

    <h1>The story of my apps and my life</h1>

    <p>At the end of 2020, I started to learn how to code and learned relentlessly because I had nothing else to do, at
        that time I also knew that I was going to become an entrepreneur and this always starts with developing a hard
        skill until mastery. While I didn't know at that time what my first software project would be, I knew that I
        would specialize in Android development, as this would build a touchable, interactive, and something more valid
        software for a business. However, after trying hard to learn how to code, I burned out already in the spring of
        2021
        and a few months passed until my progress leaped by partaking in a Belarusian programming course on Android
        development. A few months went by and in December of 2021, I built the first prototype of an app… which would
        become significant later. </p>

    <p>You see, I was annoyed by my low mental math capabilities and therefore I wanted to create a mental math app
        myself, it felt, as if low mental math capabilities made me look stupid occasionally. I almost wrote that this
        was my first idea, but that turned out to be wrong as I recalled brainstorming a lot of different ideas. After
        the programming course ended in the spring of 2022, I took a small break from programming and dedicated my
        attention to YouTube, which also bridged the phase between the programming phase in 2021 and the start of the
        programming course. After around 2 weeks, I programmed in parallel to YouTube and started to build my first app,
        Helimath, at that time called “Math + Helicopter” and the progress was extremely slow, even though I tried my
        best. You must acknowledge, that in the summer of 2022, ChatGPT didn't exist, I still had a bunch of bad habits
        and I had no experience. That means, programming was quite difficult for me and the progress was therefore very
        slow, but the programming course taught me how to not care about it how to solve problems, and how to educate
        myself. </p>

    <p>I remember a summer day, in 2022. I had still been working on my app, but it still had a remarkably low quality
        and would not have survived as a business, because I had to remind myself <em>where I came from and where I
            would
            go.</em> On this day I talked with someone at my internship in the college's IT-Electronics field of study.
        During
        this conversation it hit me: I could add a game to my app to add something unique and fun. A mental math app
        that helps you to make progress by making the progress fun. One thing was certain: my skills were by far too
        insufficient to implement such an endeavor. But I had a goal, a vision, a will, time, and a lot of pressure,
        there was nothing that could have stopped me. I started to work the hardest I have ever worked in my life and
        probably the hardest I ever will. My days consisted of only programming, which had been extremely hard with no
        expertise and without ChatGPT, and still I was my life was full of bad habits - that's what makes this feat so
        incredible because the conditions were wrong and I did it anyway, I fought every single day I have never done
        before. Then we went to Rome for 5 days and I got sick. That didn't matter, I rested a bit and got back to work
        as soon as possible. Then we went to Bulgaria for 2 weeks and the progress continued. </p>

    <p>Then I was done. I learned so much and built an app, a fun mental math app as a result. I published it in August
        of 2022. I did know that this would be just the beginning and in the following months, my progress significantly
        accelerated because I got more advanced and started to slowly fix my life, for example, every time I ran into an
        error message, I would sprint outside 100 steps and do 12 pullups. I never forgot that I created my app for
        business in the first place and therefore I started to create simple YouTube shorts where I would talk about my
        progress using my own voice for the first time. This took until October to start, I didn't have the mental
        capacity to speak in front of the microphone, because I just started improving my speech. The videos never
        succeeded and I quit them after 70 tries in January of 2023. In October I also presented my apps in front of a
        jury for the first time and won the first prize.</p>

    <p>In December of 2022, things changed for the first time significantly, because I left this “work, work, work”
        phase for the first time and started to have, even if only occasionally, free time. Before December I didn't
        talk to anyone, and there I started to socialize for the first time. For one, I had too much trauma to talk to
        anyone, and for the second part, I slowed down my app's development for the first time, because I advanced my
        skills far enough to reach a high working speed. My life started to change drastically at that time too, as I
        got rid of all my bad habits at once for 2 weeks, although I slipped back in the coming winter, but at least on
        a much lower level. It may not be clear what I'm referring to with bad habits, I am talking about useless
        content consumption, specifically, short-form content. </p>

    <p>Then it was January of 2023 and a lot of things happened in parallel. For the first time, I reached
        <em>immense</em>
        productivity, meaning I could brainstorm up to 70 ideas a day multiple times each week, and implement them
        because of advanced skills and lifestyle changes. If you gave me an idea, I would give you 5 cents for it. Most
        of the ideas die after just a few minutes but one day in January was significant enough to be remembered for the
        rest of my life. On this particular day, Thursday 12th of January we had no school, instead every university had
        an open-door day and I went into a physics lecture in Dresden. Initially, I thought that my time would have been
        better spent at home working but something interesting happened. The physics lecture lasted 90 minutes and I got
        bored so hard that my mind started to go anywhere I came up with multiple good ideas, the most important being
        the idea of creating a mental math app for old people, as I saw an even greater potential in this idea, since
        old people are better software users. They are loyal, have a long attention span and their demands aren't so
        high because they are more grateful. Excellent, that mental progress is even more significant for old people
        than it is for young people. The same day in January I implemented the idea and was done after 2 weeks with the
        prototype.</p>

    <p>In February of 2023, I started to advertise for the first time, after procrastinating with it for a while, the
        same way I procrastinated with the microphone. Procrastination is not about not being productive, because my
        output was still immense at that time, but I didn't do the task with the highest possible learning potential in
        the long run. I built up a bunch of fear and then I started to advertise and then I failed anyway and built up
        even more fear as a result. </p>

    <p>Then in March of 2023, I implemented another idea from that day in Dresden. Mental math specialized for the gym.
        I planned that app and didn't just start and for the first time, I even documented everything. The greatest
        thing about this app is that it provided a testing ground for new ideas for my original apps. (Don't forget
        where you come from and where you go.) After I created this app, I started to <em>make my hair </em>. </p>

    <p>In April of 2023, I started visiting business lectures as well and started to advance further, by creating polls
        for example. </p>

    <p>All of a sudden, a lot of time got released because I started to care about things completely unrelated to
        business for the first time (and this time the thing you think is probably the one I'm implying). I also started
        to improve my social skills for the first time, and I started with my YouTube channel and I restarted to write a
        diary for the first time in April. Until June of 2023, I steadily worked on my apps and made them better.
        “Steadily” may not be the correct phrasing, as my speed was higher than ever before. In parallel, I was making
        progress in other areas, such as social stuff, YouTube, writing, meditating, speaking, and the gym. Those things
        are nice and I could <em>afford</em> them because my skills could now surpass or at least come close to
        professionals,
        lifestyle changes, and ChatGPT, combined with pressure, a goal and boredom made me achieve in a day what would
        take most people a few days. By the way, I do recommend you to go the same path, of getting hard skills and then
        using them to free yourself and then to advance in other areas of life. I had trained myself to not
        procrastinate, not to waste any time, and not to fear anything and that was how my life looked like until June…
        when I burned out. I burned out not only because of working too hard, but rather because I was working too much,
        and I simply ran out of ideas, Because I was doing so much, around 50 failures accumulated at the same time.</p>


    <p>Also, in June other things happened, (easy-to-remember dates: 1.6, 9.6, 18.6.). While neither of these events
        will be discussed in this text, 18.6.2023 was the date, when I stopped to work on everything. Prior to this, I
        was unwell emotionally because at the 50 (and then 51) failures, on 18.6.2023 I made a discovery and had to
        absolutely prioritize it… I don't know what I was doing on the days from 20.6 to 30.6 of 2023. It was as if they
        didn't exist. I didn't read, didn't listen to music, I didn't watch YouTube, and I have absolutely no memories
        from that time and I didn't write a diary in that time either. I was simply going on walks and to the gym every
        day.</p>

    <p>I didn't do anything related to my business in July either, except that I wrote stories like this one. Then the
        summer holidays of 2023 approached their end. I did do the 10,000 math task challenge to promote my app. I
        failed with advertising in February, 6 months ago, and I procrastinated with it. It took a lot of mental effort
        to start advertising again and I did start again and failed anyway. But these summer holidays were extremely
        important because they removed my fear because I failed, and they made me attempt any challenge, such as the
        10,000 math task challenge. </p>

    <h1>The Final Battle</h1>

    <p>2 weeks went by and the ad campaigns failed, I learned a lot. I build a solid app. I think, now is the time to
        start one last effort to test my ideas. Here is what I plan to do. For 1 week, I will invest 20€ in advertising,
        this should deliver 500 downloads. This ad campaign differs from the rest because it will use all types of media
        and choose the best one, it will choose also the best performer of each media type, for example, I can upload 5
        videos and Google will determine the best one.</p>

    <p>And here is what made me cut the rope and replace it with a metal chain. I didn't know about this type of ad,
        which is purely result-oriented, but this will provide the final test of my first app. If the 500 downloads
        won't be reached, the idea of a fun mental math app will die. If I reach them and they don't grow, the idea dies
        as well and gets put into the chest, just as the rope. If everything goes well and I reach 500 downloads and
        they start to grow, it would prove that I was correct all along. In both cases, the temporary rope will be
        replaced with a solid metal chain.</p>

    <p>This is the final battle.</p>

    <p>The next few days will determine everything.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h1>The visionary</h1>

    <p>On 1.6.2023, I wrote in my diary that feelings can't be ignored in a sustainable way, as I noticed a strong
        decline in productivity, and coorlation between emotinal well-beeing and productivity, therefore, here are my
        thoughts on this whole project: I feel indifferent. Just like
        the bittersweet piano, the lessons and experiences remain unaffected by the result. Everything I learned will be
        useful later, even if only in 10 years and every product that I created is an asset. Maybe, if I stop caring
        about results, the growth of the apps will come on its own <em>at the right time</em>. </p>

    <p>If I should fail, I think I … Here is the concept of a visionary. A visionary has a goal, but this goal misaligns
        with the common perception because she/he is placed at the wrong time. But the visionary doesn't care about
        anything, because she/he is convinced by their idea. Eventually, it often leads to spectacular things. For
        example, the people who knew about AI or cryptocurrencies were visionaries who proved correct after 15 years.
        They did things differently and didn't listen to anyone else - the results and rewards were accordingly strong.
        But there is a difference between a first project having visionary attributes because it didn't have outside
        influence and a truly life-changing discovery like the one on 18.6.2023. There would be no point in investing
        further effort into my first app if it fails here because my energy would be better spent working on a real
        vision rather than a level 0 vision.</p>

    <p>A success would be nice, it would give me safety and if it succeeds,
        it means that the concept was working and I could “lay back” for a few weeks. The monetary rewards would be
        great too, and the lessons are independent of results anyway. If it fails, on the other hand, it will force me
        to work on other things, such as my YouTube channel or on a real vision. That's why the indifference of the
        bittersweet piano in both cases is great. In both cases, I enter a new chapter of my life, which is one where I
        stop my first project and move on. - If I fail, I will move on.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it's possible to write more powerful thoughts a priori before the events cover the lessons and thoughts
        in noise. </p>

    <p>You need to think long-term in order to achieve anything. If I didn't think long-term, there would be nothing
        remarkable happening, where I wouldn't disappear for 10 days and provide such a lesson afterward. But sometimes,
        unfortunately, things don't work out in the intended way, no matter how hard you try or how valid your thoughts
        and efforts have been. Note, that this doesn't apply to things like relationships, because in these cases you
        are responsible and things are fully in your control. </p>

    <h1>A priori part ends here</h1>

    <p>Now, as I found out about this result-driven ad approach, I tried to implement it right away (speed is key) and
        quit, because I noticed that this would take multiple hours to set up and I didn't have the time. Today,
        Thursday the 7th of September I don't have the first 2 lessons because of an appointment related to my driver's
        license at 8:30. That means, I now have at least 2.5 hours, as it's 5:27 the moment I'm writing this.</p>

    <p>Now, it's 11:53 and I'm in a lesson in school right now it took significantly longer to set up this ad campaign,
        as this ad campaign required me to write 5 slogans, 5 short descriptions, add a bunch of images, as well as
        countless videos. Luckily, I already created them a while back, on Thursday of the last summer holiday week and
        so I took them and created them in portrait aspect ratio all of these things took substantially longer than
        expected. The only thing I have to complete now is to transfer some money, 100€ to Google Ads. I got done at
        12:47. </p>

    <p>Waiting starts now.</p>


    <h1>Results come in the end</h1>

    <p>The ads did fail, I tried my best. I am free again and a new chapter of my life may start today, on 8.9.2023. The
        previous chapter was where I was working on my first project. Now a new chapter of insights and new perspectives
        starts.</p>

    <p>I am free from my apps, but I still have other things to work on. My other apps, “18.6.2023”, my YouTube channel
        as well as another massive lifestyle change: building a solid foundation. There are a lot of things with extreme
        leverage I can do to give me a solid foundation. I know what these tasks are and will write about them in them
        in the next blogs. I will also pursue the “9.6.2023”, although that's not in my control anymore. These things
        include mostly speaking, writing, and thinking. Essentially, by reading 1 poem a day out loud you can elevate
        your speaking skills into the 99th percentile in just a few weeks. The return on investment is even higher if I
        read poems in Russian or German. This applies to other skills as well, meaning I could dedicate 30 minutes every
        day to improving these skills and other skills too. I will also be reading way more and I will also start to
        watch YouTube again. This will make me even lonelier and unrelatable. </p>

    <p>I feel as if I should cut the rope and delete the first app from the internet and wipe anything related to it.
        This would give my words new meaning and cut out any alternatives - that's what a decision means. But this would
        be irrational because the apps remain a great asset and maybe the right time may come for them. I should move on
        and make peace with my apps, but it's not reasonable to cut them because they have no downsides, most of the
        memories associated with them remain positive. On the other hand, if I deleted them, I would lose 1 year's worth
        of assets and gain a new perspective, one where I could not lay back on existing things and would need to step
        forward with both feet instead to replace the rope with a metal necklace. But this time, the metal necklace
        simply gets added. Beautiful.</p>

    <p>Today something else changed that underlined the entry of a new life-chapter. As I went to the gym today, my
        mother organized a personal trainer for 1 hour to create a workout routine for me, where I would no longer
        “just” do something with a plan and knowledge instead. It's the same thing as this whole business stuff. </p>

    <p>I don't know where I will be in the near future and I am excited about it. I have great hopes, great desires, and
        even more dedication and commitment for this new period in my life. Just like the rope that got laid for years
        on my shelf and then got replaced by a metal necklace. </p>

    <p>One more thought. My blog consisted of roughly 40,000 words and 60 blogs as I wrote this text, which I wrote over
        the span of 3 days. This text alone consists of 4300 words, which means every 11th word can be mapped to this
        text alone. It's not only the micro-moments that add up and make a difference, the big things matter too.</p>

    <h1>Final insights</h1>

    <p>Now you have been reading for a very while and I think I should condense the actual meaning of this text. My life
        path of not caring about anything and building up skills ruthlessly, fixing my life, and finally slowing down
        and <em>making my hair</em> as the last step was and is the right path. Making your hair before there is
        something to
        back it up is thought too short-sighted. Build a solid foundation and then start to care about others and “fun”
        things.</p>

    <p>Competence is the key. You need to get competent (=hard skills) before you do or try anything else.</p>

    <p>One thing is certain. The old necklace is cut and there is no way back.</p>

    <h1>This advice will save you years</h1>

    <p>If you have an idea for something, think about it for a few days. In this scenario, you are allowed to
        procrastinate, as you have to analyze everything and strip the idea into its fabric. I saw the problem and
        created the product, then I started to advertise and then I started to ask people about it. </p>

    <p>That's not how you do it. You could start by talking to people, but then, social influences interfere with your
        intent of acquiring valuable information. Rather, talking to people should reveal to yourself if an idea is
        right, by further formulating it, although this process can be shortcut with journaling. After you formulated
        your idea to the fullest, and after you have determined the right target demographic, you should invest 50€ -
        100€ to run ads to determine the validity of your projects. </p>

    <p>It's not expensive considering how much time it will save you. Don't worry about the ad's quality, because if the
        idea is great, people will use it anyway. If you are still insecure about the ad's quality, there is a way to
        add multiple images/videos and texts and Google will pick the best one automatically. The received data is the
        greatest asset because it reflects reality directly. This data shows that people are interested and willing to
        spend money on it. Now you may be wondering, where the ad should link to. Well, use forms.google.com to create
        an E-Mail list. Write something similar to “Gain early access for free now”, write in the other person's
        interest! If no one gives you their email address or if no one clicks on the ad, that means, the idea wasn't
        correct. If most people, your target should be 60%, give their email address the idea is valid and you can start
        to work on it. If you aren't selling digital products, you can do the same, but you should rather build a fake
        online store, and admit to the user that the products aren't available right now. </p>

    <p>The only real downside to this method is that you may waste 5000€ on the high end (=75 failed ideas) and only
        then find the one that works. Again, this is nothing in comparison to the potential reward, especially
        considering the saved time. But this method will be depressing, and it will cause severe mental problems if you
        fail too often at a time and also in the waiting phase where you wait for the results. But you have to face
        failures anyway and there is no point in trying to prevent that. Some entrepreneurs told me, that beer can help
        against too many failures at the same time. Rejection isn't personal unless it's done via phone. Before online
        ads existed, they took a phone book and called many people and got rejected most of the time, that's why it was
        necessary. Eventually, you will build up the tolerance for failing, and therefore I would advise against trying
        to shortcut this process with alcohol. If you are still hesitant to use this method, I can remove another
        limiting belief at this instant. Talk with other people and let them support you emotionally and mentally and to
        keep you accountable at the same time - like this, it will become even easier. Alternatively, fight on your own
        like I did. </p>

    <p>This method is the fastest and the intent of this text is to prevent you from repeating the mistakes, that I
        made, and to save time and effort. You may be tempted to think, that your path then won't be as full as this
        one. Not true, you will simply gain experience working on the right things. You can still fail, although you
        will then fail with even more knowledge. If you then start with blogging, I will need to fear you ;-) </p>
