    <h1>The order and chaos</h1>

    <p>Today I woke up voluntarily at 5 a.m. because I wanted to write a text on how to why competence is the key to
        worldly success. I was hyped up <em>to the point where I didn't press snooze and got up directly</em>. But at
        the end
        of the morning, I have accomplished exactly nothing, which is a shame considering I have had no bad habits for 6
        months now and have already implemented almost any positive lifestyle change. I failed to write the text because
        I felt lost. I thought about my blog, and how I didn't like certain texts, especially the ones where I talk
        about economic stuff or products. That's because my teacher wanted to read a selection of texts and I couldn't
        decide which ones to present, because the categories were kind of irrelevant, for example, "14 days of
        insights>”
        is supposed to have the same weight as “Testing old business knowledge”? To add another thing, I was told that I
        write things impossible to be known by a 16-year-old - at a pace unmatched. 10,000 words in as little as 10
        days, all entirely unique and new ideas. So, I tried to map every principle I have covered in my adventures with
        high resolution into a map, to make the selection easier. I listed all of the principles and realized that there
        are around 60 of them, and they all interact with each other, so extracting atomic principles would become
        impossible. Then I looked at my collection of quotes “Life-changing ideas seem insignificant in text” and
        realized, that I didn't need to summarize every principle I have ever explained. So, that's how I wasted my
        morning, additionally, my throat hurt because I got sick. Coincidentally, this morning didn't have a colorful
        sunrise as the <em>ordinary</em> day, rather, plain grey sky, indifferent.</p>

    <p>Now, what have you just spent a minute of your life reading, why did I overly explain something of complete
        insignificance? It does scare off readers who aren't willing to put in the effort of decrypting the text, sure,
        and there is some value in trying to understand my thoughts.</p>

    <p>However, ultimately, they are useless, because you and I aren't the thinkers, we are just our souls communicating
        with our bodies with the help of thoughts. The direct communication of your soul and the world is called
        enlightenment. In the same way, you aren't your body, you are your soul. This text
        will provide a detailed yet incomplete guide on order, the masculine and chaos, the feminine.</p>

    <h1>What's a thought and what's presence?</h1>

    <p>Yesterday I went for a walk and I got a new cognition, that would lead to the creation of this text. My times for
        walks have not <em>changed</em> and neither did my route. I still go for a 10 km walk. The
        only things that <em>change</em> are the weather, people, nature, and when the sun sets. Currently, the sun
        sets at 19:00. That means, it's getting dark towards the end of my walks, yet I still haven't adapted. While
        walking yesterday, I noticed why being mentally online is hard. It's because your brain creates an illusion of
        the real world, a low-resolution projection, a flat one in your mind. That means you are blind. As it hit me, I
        did see a hedge and little gardens hidden behind it, I saw the bridge I was on and the asphalt path it was
        crossing as well as an ugly factory building on the other side of the river, which was right of me. The river
        was already fading from azure to navy. It was quiet, the only noises were created by birds flying by and the
        water, flowing around the countless stones in the river. But I noticed I only saw the projection of it inside of
        my head, rather than the essence. My mind was constructing a reality for me, therefore, it's possible to see and
        to be blind at the same time. Even, if you try to focus on your sensory input, it's still impossible to <em>wake
            up</em>, because you would be thinking about the sensory input at that time. </p>

    <p>Yet, you are not the thinker, you are your soul, and that's why it's meaningless to see, consciously too, if you
        never grasped the <em>meaning</em>. To recapitulate, thoughts are projections, created by your body and mind,
        not your
        soul. You could “see” the exact same thing, and yet make no meaning of it, because your soul needs to see
        something, <em>as it is</em> rather than a projection of it created by your body and mind, communicating with
        thoughts.
    </p>

    <h1>It all makes sense now</h1>

    <p>Of course, I didn't <em>discover</em> this myself it has already been known for thousands of years, but is still
        hidden,
        and now I know why. So far, the only spiritual books I read or started to read include, the bible, “Sun Tzu on
        the Art of War” and “Maps of Meaning - The Architecture of Belief” by Jordan Peterson. Most notably, the 3rd
        book kept talking about <em>unknown</em> concepts to me. It discussed the <em>feminine</em>, the
        <em>masculine</em>, novelty,
        explored territory, meaning, myths, knowledge, memory, tyranny, existence, religion, spirituality, and many more
        concepts I knew vaguely about. Most of the concepts are self-explanatory for further investigation and
        relatively easy to grasp if you have experience. Every concept covered in this book told whether it's
        <em>feminine</em>
        or <em>masculine</em> and even though I thought what it meant, turns out I didn't, it also didn't matter that
        the book
        explained that explained the essence: feminine stands for everything changing, the chaos and masculine for
        everything standing still, the order.
    </p>

    <p>I appreciate that it started to make sense on page 200 of 600, and not months after I had finished this book ;-)
    </p>

    <p>Turns out…</p>

    <p>Everything you thought to know about the order, the masculine, and the chaos of the feminine is to a large extent
        nonsense, low resolution, and sometimes it means the exact opposite. For example, weakness has nothing to do
        with either of these concepts, and neither of them has anything to do with being an “alpha” Sometimes, it can be
        outright misleading, yet I know too little about it to formulate a blog about it on the internet for eternity,
        although I can talk on the spiritual definition of masculinity, the order, as these concepts are already
        omnipresent in every text of mine, except for the introduction of this one, where I <em>changed</em>.</p>

    <h1>Chaos, the spiritual feminine</h1>

    <p>The introduction of this text marks constant change, I didn't write the text as intended on the previous day, in
        the morning, instead, I didn't write it at all. I let external influences guide my thoughts and therefore I let
        the chaos control me, therefore I acted spiritually feminine. Yes, I needed to include such a story, because you
        won't find many of them. </p>

    <p>The chaos doesn't necessitate inaction like in this scenario but rather adaptation and change itself. It's the
        sun setting at different times each day, the chaotic feminine crowds, or the weather. It's different constantly.
        Crowds are feminine, almost exclusively. Crowds represent chaotic systems, as small initial <em>changes</em>
        result in
        large changes in the after<em>math</em>. The weather is a chaotic system as well. Let's talk about math here for
        a
        second, that's what you know me for, right ;-)</p>

    <p>Math itself is ordered, as 1 is always 1, “is” means “is”*, not “is” means “seems”. That's what this sign is for
        “=” On the contrary is applied math almost exclusively chaotic, for example, statistics. Things get blurry, as
        you discover their essence because, on a fundamental level, the physical, everything appears to be ideal and
        ordered, yet small imperfections and fundamental imperfections on small levels transform physics into something
        changing, no experiment can be truly repeated. Here is where it gets interesting: physicists use formulas, and
        these don't change. They are the very definition of order, the masculine. </p>

    <p>Here is a selection of femininsm from my texts:</p>

    <p><a href="blog_64.html">#</a> “One thing is certain. The old necklace is cut and there is no way back.”<br><br>
        <a href="blog_64.html">#</a> “I feel as if I should cut the rope and delete the first app from the internet and
        wipe anything related to it.
        This would give my words new meaning and cut out any alternatives - that's what a decision means.“<br><br>
        <a href="blog_55.html">#</a> “Whenever I go to school, I see how no one is motivated to do basically anything”
    </p>


    <h1>Order, the spiritual masculine</h1>

    <p>Throughout all of my texts, there are a few common yet unexplicit messages, best summarized by “do it anyway”
        Most notable for these principles are the stories, for example, the story “Failures kill”, “Photography”, or
        “Uncertainty” It's about simply doing things, and not looking at the results. Not being scared of anything and
        simply executing, independent of expectations or results. You need to be the leader, the competent one, you need
        to make decisions and be fast. It's about being unchanged, stoic, and most important of all <em>online</em>
        totally
        present. Your mind must show cracks and you need to overcome them, as discussed in text #70. It's about making
        categorical decisions and staying at them. Here is a collection of quotes from my texts, demonstrating absolute
        masculinity. I noticed, as I tried to pick them, that almost everything I write has nothing feminine about it,
        quite the contrary, I sort my thoughts by writing these texts.</p>

    <p><a href="blog_52.html">#</a> “Do it anyway”<br><br>
        <a href="blog_50.html">#</a> “I failed, built up even more fear as a result, and resolved it”<br><br>
        <a href="blog_70.html">#</a> “Presence is attractive”<br><br>
        <a href="blog_63.html">#</a> “Get your subconscious to work towards your goals. Your mind may be working against
        you at this very
        instant”<br><br>
        <a href="blog_25.html">#</a> “Things take as long as you want them to”<br><br>
        <a href="blog_12.html">#</a> “What does it mean, to decide? Making a decision means focusing on and cutting out
        alternatives.”<br><br>

        Today, as I came home from school, I was still sick and didn't <em>feel like</em> doing anything. I thought
        that's all
        right, I can afford to rest a bit. My motivation to do something plummeted, and I didn't want to write anything
        today. I thought, I've written already enough. But I've had enough, took my laptop and wrote something. “And […]
        saw it was good” I didn't feel like it and did it anyway. I don't let motivation and desire dictate my day.
    </p>

    <h1>Feminine and Masculine</h1>

    <p>As you saw both the masculine and feminine pieces of content, the quotes, you may have noticed that they aren't
        too different. They are. “One thing is certain” is a reaction, just like the clouds react to the weather, and
        are chaotic, “Do it anyway” stands categorically for itself. It is order, as “do it anyway” implies that this
        action will straighten the path through the chaos. </p>

    <p>Judge for yourself how much order and chaos your life has, especially your personality. No one is 100% masculine,
        that's only possible for something like a computer, as a computer is nothing more than math.</p>

    <p>In text #71 I discussed the concepts of online (=presence, mindfulness, and soul), offline (mindless), and how
        the worst-case scenario is to be stuck in the middle. Because then, the soul is released and craves presence or
        needs to get numbed, otherwise negatives of the mind occur, such as stress or worries. The same applies here,
        because presence (=online) shows parallels, as they are both spiritual concepts. You can be happy as a feminine
        woman or as a masculine man, and everything in the middle is the default position and undesirable, because
        cracks start to pop up and negatives of mind appear, or to speak more concisely, it gets boring! You aren't
        supposed to be stuck in the middle. If opposites attract each other, so do strong magnets have higher forces
        than neutral pieces of iron, they have none. That's going to be missing, as a result, you will suffer more than
        necessary. I find it particularly strange to see young people in the middle, aren't they missing something?</p>

    <p>Now, you may be wondering, how you could become more polarized. It's simple, follow my texts to become more
        masculine, and follow your heart to become more feminine. Learn more about spiritual books, or if they are too
        hard, watch YouTube, I have done the same.</p>


    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

    <p>*This is unrelated to the text, therefore any analysis of the text doesn't need to include this part. I find it
        interesting that the Russian word for “is” means “seems to be” and “is” at the same time. In any context, it's
        not clear what version is the right one. Perhaps, “is” symbolizes a simplified “seems to be” Although the
        Russian language consists of riddles covered in a mystery, in general. There are many more easter eggs like
        this. “Goodbye” can be translated into “Until the next date” and “Thank you” into “God save” Overall, Russian is
        well thought through <em>(almost too well)</em>. Another example is looking at the origins of words. “Tomorrow”
        derives
        from the words “behind the morning” The word for family shares similarities with “7” and with “seed” and the
        word “please” derives from “I wish you stand well”</p>
