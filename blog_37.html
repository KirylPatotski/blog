    <h1>Uplifting products</h1>

    <p>A long time ago, I created my Google Play developer page's slogan to “Improve mental math”. But today this
        changed, since I changed it to “Uplifting products” as this slogan is more universal and represents a brand
        shift overall, that I decided to make, because “Uplifting products” can apply to almost anything. Almost.</p>

    <p>In today's world, there are only a few brands that stand out because of enormous quality, environmental concerns,
        workers' rights, and affordable prices at the same time. Before we get into that, we need to dive deep into the
        world of today's most influential consumer brands and Western life itself and why I think it's a moral
        obligation to comply with the best standards there are, and why you should never create degrading products.
        Before we do that, let's talk about history a little bit.</p>

    <p>Adam Smith, the inventor of capitalism in the 18th century did not differ from Karl Marx, the inventor of
        communism in the 19th century. They both believed, that the task of an economy is not to serve the kings and
        their palaces but rather to serve the people and help them solve massive problems. The motivation why
        individuals should participate in such economies differed, while Adam Smith suggested that individuals would
        want to do this because of their own desire, but Karl Marx disagreed on that point. So, the key idea is that
        economies are there to help people to create a better life, regardless of which modern ideology. </p>

    <p>But what happens, if the society, that controls the economy, breaks apart? Then degrading products will rise,
        degrading for once health, soul, freedom, the workers, the environment as well as bodily integrity. Look at
        every major brand and you will see, how damaging they truly are. How can you have a functioning society if the
        products in the society degenerate? Maybe I got everything wrong, and the broken fabric of society creates
        broken products, I am not sure. Even most digital companies are hyper-exploitative, who tests every software and
        makes sure it's safe? It's the same Africans or Asians who manufacture the clothes and everything else under
        cruel working conditions. If a company is not guilty of destroying the environment, which is almost impossible,
        what they sell or offer is most likely hardcore degrading, 1/3 of the entire content on the internet is only
        that. But the other 2/3 are not that much better either … Even if a company doesn't kill the environment or its
        workers, video games still degrade.</p>

    <p>That's why I believe, creating a company with good intent is more important than anything else, and making sure
        that what the company sells uplifting product is necessary. I don't believe in creating products that directly
        or indirectly make someone's life worse is the proper way to deal with business. Your products need to excel in
        every field and be good for the soul and your brand needs to lead with example.</p>

    <p>I could advertise, how I write blogs/create videos that are uplifting or apps that are uplifting themselves, (or
        at least neutral), but I want to do something else here. When you hear about a company that matches good working
        conditions, high-quality products, sustainability, and products built with good intent, this company is
        Victorinox, a Swiss company manufacturing affordable high-quality products, like knives, suitcases, watches, and
        perfumes. That's my great example. I don't believe, that for example, Tesla is that good of a brand, because
        their products, cars, are harmful and don't elevate and lack in quality. Because how can a Tesla car be
        elevating, if it promotes video games instead of perfection?</p>

    <p>I think the recent development of sustainable companies selling uplifting products is a good sign, although, as
        you see I don't name any examples. That's because the small and sustainable companies selling uplifting products
        are now insignificant and if they stop being insignificant, their noble goals may disappear by then - that's why
        I would exceptional marketing is necessary in order to cement a brand's solidity and purpose of improving.</p>
