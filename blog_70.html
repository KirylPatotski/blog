    <h1>Desperate awakening</h1>

    <p>Why do you fall in love, argue for nothing, procrastinate, and create problems seemingly out of nowhere? Why
        isn't the world a plain desert but rather a diverse biotope, or at least, why don't people settle in the
        abundance of space in an empty desert? Why does it rain after all? </p>

    <p>Simple, the rain transforms the void desert into a meaningful space, a forest for example, which is suitable for
        people to settle in and therefore of meaning. So, people crave meaning as the result of the fight against
        indifference, and the rain itself creates the value and meaning, not the land itself, to capture the meaning, as
        the land exists in either case, but the absence of rain prevents any further development of the void desert and
        makes it boring - and by extension worthless.</p>

    <p>So, why do you do you fall in love, argue for nothing, procrastinate, and create problems seemingly out of
        nowhere? </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>Today I heard something that spiked my emotions in a negative sense. When that happens, and here we may differ, I
        feel a sensation in my stomach area, it feels just like stress, but bundled up into a single moment. While
        experiencing it, I knew with certainty I would end up documenting this experience. What I heard therefore
        doesn't matter and it was perhaps ripped out of context anyway. However, there is one thing I noticed intense
        stress had in common with procrastination and useless arguments, they <em>give a slap from reality</em> and put
        you
        back in the current moment. All of a sudden everything else seems to turn indifferent. It's like waking up from
        a nightmare and realizing that you are all right. It's the craving for awakening caused by mindlessness that's
        desperately trying to escape, and because it is desperate, it does it through uncomfortable situations. While
        you may procrastinate all day, be entirely <em>offline</em>, mindless so to speak, the stress caused by
        procrastination
        and stress in general try to wake you, to forget about everything else and simply to put you back into the
        current moment. If you neglect your loved ones, they will start to argue with you to set things straight as a
        side result, but mostly to remind you of the present moment.</p>


    <p>After and during the rain, or the argument in this case, everything else seems to turn indifferent, and
        unexpected calmness arrives. Just as the quietness, and lull - even more so after a thunderstorm. Useless
        negative emotions and their spike, therefore, try to gift your mind moments of presence, that it desperately
        needs, just as the lush forest needs the rain. </p>

    <h1>Online and offline</h1>

    <p>Did you really read this text, letter by letter, syllable, by syllable, sentence by sentence, idea by idea,
        paragraph by paragraph or did you only notice how unexpected this sentence sounds at this very instant? If yes,
        then what were you doing 1 hour previously or 1 month ago? Most people, grossly overestimate their presence as
        they never experienced an <a href="blog_44.html">elevated state of mind</a> continuously, therefore they don't
        even know that such things
        are within reach. Especially considering…</p>

    <p>Being constantly offline is similar to being constantly online. In both cases, you are living in your world,
        while offline you are detached from the real world and simply reside within your thoughts. That's the same thing
        as being completely online, as you have very few thoughts and live in your reality as well, with the only
        difference being the morph of your reality with the outside, the objective reality visible to outsiders. This
        phenomenon is similar to the idea of “ego death”, one where you see your body as just a part of the universe and
        you start to see yourself from some kind of 3rd person, in parts detached from your body. Your soul is free in
        that case. However, online means total presence, meaning the worlds of your mind and reality match. </p>

    <p>What sucks is to be in the middle, in the phase of mixed presence, online and offline at the same time. That's
        when cracks start to show in your reality, and as a result severe mental suffering such as stress,
        procrastination, fear, worries, and other things occur. Ultimately, you need to use these cracks to break free,
        as it's not quite meaningful to live with a deserted mind, one of zero presence. I find it very ironic, that
        some people (notably those that never meditated for example) claim that I've completely detached from reality.
        No, I have just arrived at it, I got enlightened. Related to this idea are bad habits. But they don't awaken
        you, they numb you, that's the difference, and this difference isn't that huge. </p>

    <p>What does being stuck in traffic has anything to do with presence, mindfulness, and enlightenment? Nothing. What
        are you thinking about in those moments, have you ever been present while doing so? The simple answer is no and
        it is the correct one. Being half-offline and half-online at the same time hurts. Insecurities, stress, and
        worries reappear. Worries disappear with total presence and the total indifference of bad habits. The concept of
        mindless time transcends many concepts unrelated, such as meaningless work. That's the reason I believe
        work-life balance to be a lie. Free time, or time spent without an occupation, such as driving or idle time is
        time wasted, not spent in presence, but rather in mindlessness, offline. The transition between totally offline
        and complete presence is the worst state possible. It's easier to prevent the middle if you have a goal - all
        other people experience immense mental suffering (and they may not even know it).</p>

    <p>Presence is one of the many keys to happiness. It removes any negative aspects of the mind and makes you focus on
        what's important. As discussed previously, presence isn't a fundamental need of the mind, it is the mind itself
        that wants to communicate with your soul. Reaching mindfulness starts by breathing correctly. Don't breathe
        shallowly, breathe like a king! Every time you find yourself taking shallow breaths, you have found yourself
        offline again and fix it. Presence is a skill too. Next to catching offline moments, you need to meditate as
        well. How do you think you feel after meditation? </p>

    <p>The same as after a conflict, except without the negative side effects, faster and more consistent. After doing
        this for a long while, your body will start to detach from your soul, but that's temporary, as your soul simply
        shines through for the first time and somewhen, your body and soul will unite again. </p>

    <p>Your soul doesn't know fatigue or instant gratification and neither does it know any other negative limitation of
        the body and the mind. Your soul just exists <em>for itself</em> and this detachment from your body is a first
        attempt
        to make you free, your soul takes control, and your body starts to feel like a tool. It becomes
        <em>impossible</em> to
        have bad habits, as your body desires instant gratification and not your soul. Negativity, stress, and anxiety
        fade as well, as this detachment occurs. Are you still breathing correctly? Likewise, total presence, being
        online is similar to being numbed by bad habits, meaning being offline entirely.

    <h1>The only way to live</h1>

    <p>As I was younger, I got sad when I got asked what the meaning of life is. It's simple. Discover everything your
        mind and soul are capable of, on the side, reaching enlightenment, competence, and enormous material success as
        a fine side project. There is no doubt, no matter what philosophy may be your favorite, that this path will end
        up making you the happiest. You won't regret it.</p>

    <p>Here is one more thing. I didn't change over the years. I still had the same goals and visions. I had my YouTube
        channel already in 2021 for example and my programming endeavor already in 2020, yet no one cared. It's not
        making my hair or going to the gym that made the difference either since I already had a six-pack my whole life.
        Only as I fixed and developed my mind, I started to become <em>attractive</em>. The rest is just a bonus. You
        don't
        have to rely on my insights alone, in fact, they are already listed in the bible. The story of the bible starts
        with humans being objects, living by God's rules, unfree. But then, Eve gets tempted by reality and wants to
        wake up even at the expense of immortality. After waking up herself, she wakes up her man too. Afterwards, God
        punishes this first sin, by banning the first people from paradise and instead bringing them into the real
        world. Here you are right now, it is time to wake up!</p>


    <p><em>{3:1} Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said
            unto
            the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
            <br><br> {3:2} And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
            <br>{3:3} But of
            the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither
            shall ye touch it, lest ye die. <br>{3:4} And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
            {3:5} For
            God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods,
            knowing
            good and evil. <br>{3:6} And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was]
            pleasant to the
            eyes, and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also
            unto her husband with her; and he did eat. <br>{3:7} And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew
            that they
            [were] naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</em>

    <h1>Difficult text, easi(er) summary</h1>

    <p>Meaning: Meaning is created by the play of order, the desert, and chaos, the rain. The desert is boring as the
        chaos misses and the chaos creates life itself because it rains.</p>

    <p>Desperate awakening: Your mind doesn't want to stand still and wants to create intense feelings, letting it rain
        so to speak. </p>

    <p>Offline: If you are completely numbed, by bad habits, worries and other negatives of the mind disappear, they are
        swept under the carpet and so is your soul.</p>

    <p>Online: Total presence is the key to happiness, as it removes and resolves any negatives in the mind as it frees
        the soul. It is the highest form of existence; it is hard to obtain. </p>

    <p>The middle, a mix of online and offline: Cracks start to show, and your mind starts to suffer. That's why you
        hate to be stuck in traffic and that's why you try to escape with bad habits to numb yourself and argue for
        nothing, because you try to achieve presence, through desperation. Your soul tries to break free through
        desperation or to hide itself in bad habits again.</p>

    <p>Your soul: Presence gives access to the soul. Your soul leads to enlightenment and total happiness.</p>

    <p>Enlightenment: Your aim for life is to discover what your mind has to offer and to get all the other material
        things on the side.</p>

    <p>Presence is attractive: The bible says, that consciousness is a need, and that's why Eve gave Adam the fruit and
        sacrificed immortality to become free, to wake up.</p>


    <h1>Appendix: Global presence</h1>

    <p>Today someone responded by claiming that the bible is nonsense, and ideology is supposedly better. However,
        ideology creates zest for the future by portraying past suffering and how it is going to be resolved, meaning,
        the present escapes into the state of offline, both in the past and the future, and the collective mind escapes
        from the praesentia, the online. That's fundamentally wrong, just as explained in detail. On the other side are
        religious texts, such as the bible. They are present, online. Therefore, religious beliefs are more compatible
        with an <a href="blog_44.html">elevated state of mind</a>, with higher forms of being (= spirituality) than other belief systems.</p>

    <p><em>{1:3} And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. {1:4} And God saw the light, that [it was] good:
            and God divided the light from the darkness. {1:5} And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
            Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</em></p>
