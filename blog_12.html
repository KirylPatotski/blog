    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In the last 2.5 years, but especially in the last 6 months, I have removed every single bad habit that I used to
        have. I used to use my phone a lot, I used to eat unhealthily, I used to distract myself with TV and I used to
        do no sports. My discipline has recently reached such a level that I can work without any music in the
        background and still be happy. </p>

    <p>The reason why you need to read this essay in the first place is caused by 3 phenomena. The first phenomenon are
        modern technologies, no doubt there. Modern technologies tend to be addictive and time-killing at once making
        them ideal to make your life a lot worse than it should be. Modern technologies are distractive, addictive,
        time-consuming, and stressful. For example, social media is a distraction and additive at once and therefore
        time-consuming and stressful, because you still have some responsibilities, but less time to complete them.
        Because of this stress, caused by the second phenomenon, a lack of time because of too many distractions, you
        distract yourself even more in order to “switch off” from all of the stress caused by the internet in the first
        place. The third phenomenon is the nail in the coffin, the hedonistic treadmill. The hedonistic treadmill
        describes that humans always want pleasure, but eventually, every pleasure source no longer provides any
        pleasure and turns into pain, to keep the overall sum of pleasure constant. Here is an example. You never shower
        warm, but then when you start to shower warm, you experience pleasure. Because everyone wants pleasure, you feel
        the urge to shower warm even more. Eventually, the warm water no longer provides any pleasure, and slowly it
        turns into pain because you realize how much your health has suffered. </p>

    <p><em>Technologies distract you → Waste of time → Stress, caused by the waste of time → “Switch off” by distracting
            yourself from the stress → Eventually distracting yourself is no longer enough → You seek new distractions
        </em></p>

    <p>This cycle is able to repeat itself, keeping the sum of pleasure and pain always at the same level. But the
        problem with this cycle is that it becomes more destructive when more time passes.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p>There are 2 single motivators, the desire to gain pleasure and the desire to minimize pain. Every motivation that
        comes into your mind can be categorized in one of them or even in both. For example, the motivation to do sports
        represents the desire for health, which in itself does nothing, but without health, you would experience pain.
        Getting rich creates pleasure in the form of e.g., freedom and avoids the pain of poverty. These 2 examples,
        both have a thing in common: they focus on the avoidance of pain rather than on the creation of pleasure. That's
        completely normal and legitimate, but that is also limiting unless you are constantly struggling and suffering.
        That means, there is actually only 1 single motivator, the desire to avoid pain at all costs.</p>

    <p>Using this knowledge, the answer to the question of how to gain motivation becomes already obsolete. Let's say
        you need motivation in order to start something life-changing, where would you place the moment of the decision,
        at an emotional high or at an emotional low? Only if you are truly unhappy, you will be willing to change, in
        order to avoid pain. </p>


    <p>If you don't experience this level of pain, which is necessary for you to break free, let a few more years pass
        by. You will see how many opportunities you missed, how much of your health got removed, how much your future
        got worse because of short-term thinking, how much potential got destroyed for nothing, how many days passed
        without progress, how often you struggled for nothing and you will realize how many years of your life have been
        wasted, how many years of your youth have been wasted, and you will gain the ultimate portion of motivation
        through something called regret, a bitter form of pain because lasting exceptionally long and unremovable. Once
        you experience this, it may already be too late to change your life, but at least you thought, that you had fun
        as you were younger.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, it's not enough to decide rationally, that you want to improve your life, because you will slip
        back towards comfort easily. You have to make your current situation as painful as possible, in order to be able
        to make exceptional progress. Visualizations can help, otherwise, there is no shortcut. You may understand this
        text now, but you will truly understand this if a bit of time has passed.</p>

    <h2>Start extreme</h2>

    <p>Once your destiny has hit you hard enough, you will be willing to change. If a few years passed and you tried to
        find this essay, here is how to transform your life. For one week, better for two weeks, you cut out any bad
        habit at once and also anything that makes “life worth living” That means, you cut out any sweets any movies,
        any stimulation, any social media, any junk food, warm water, any internet, any sugar, any coffee…</p>

    <p>And the most important thing to cut out are excuses and delays. You can't be reading this text and thinking to
        yourself that you can't live without social media, because there are your “friends and family” and also you may
        say, that you can't cut out warm water, because you have a cold right now. Then you may be thinking, that you
        can start next week. You can do this if you already have enough discipline, but otherwise cut out any delays and
        excuses, because it's only 1 or 2 weeks!</p>

    <p>What does it truly mean to decide? Deciding means, that you carve something in stone, throw the chisel and hammer
        in the river, and therefore cut out any alternatives. There are no alternatives, no easy way to avoid or to
        shortcut this process, nothing desirable is easy and reachable via a shortcut. No one admires someone with an
        easy, excuse-rich life, only the hard lives are looked up to. If you have too many excuses, remember that
        excuses are part of your belief system. But your belief system is based on your past experiences, and is used to
        predict, or manifest, the future. If you have always failed to become disciplined, of course, you believe that
        you can't do it. Do it regardless of your belief system, because only then you will be able to expand it. </p>


    <h2>Slip back</h2>
    <p>
        After you have been trying exceptionally hard to improve your life, by cutting out any pleasure, you may have
        stumbled upon a few barriers, that would make it impossible to life this way long term. Simply by reading this,
        you have one thought that you couldn't remove from your mind: “I have nothing else to do” I will explain later,
        how to resolve it.
    </p>

    <p>At the beginning of anything, the motivation is the highest. I started showering cold in December 2022 and lasted
        longer than a month later, or even 2 months later, because my determination, willpower, and motivation
        decreased. Also in that time, I cut out any other bad habit at once, except sugar, because I stopped eating
        sugar in 2020 or 2019. I knew that I needed to regain momentum by resting and continued to watch YouTube and to
        shower partially warm for around 2 months. Guess what? As I slipped back, the YouTube content seemed to be much
        more interesting, as already explained in the beginning, and warm showers seemed much nicer, that's why my
        happiness increased during that time, and it also increased in the 2 weeks of the total cut out, because I felt
        as if my actions had a significant impact. But having experienced both sides of the equation I that burning
        feeling in my chest didn't go away, because I knew that I was able to do it, I got hope. </p>

    <p>Your slip-back phase can last as long as you want it to because the will to make these changes permanent will
        exist. For me, this phase lasted around 2 months. From the middle of December 2022 to the beginning of February
        2023. </p>

    <h2>Cut out slowly</h2>

    <p>The next logical step is to cut out every bad habit one after another. You can start slowly, but if you start to
        count, you have already lost. If you start to track, for example, your screen time, you have not made enough
        progress, because you need to change systems and not result-based. That means, instead of counting how many
        pieces of chocolate you have been eating and how many you “can still eat”, you simply eat less, regardless. I
        specifically don't want to overcomplicate things, since you need to make your own experiences and try out what
        works for you, but here are some specific tips that may help you. </p>


    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>We live in 2023, and now you can identify as anything, so identify yourself as someone who doesn't
                have any bad habits. I want you to tell your friends and family about it, so they will be able to keep
                you accountable. If you have no one to be accountable to, use a notebook. Never lie to yourself!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Screen timers or app limits are valid options for the beginning, but they are not systematic and leave
                temptations. Delete your social media accounts. Now you could point out, that I still have YouTube,
                where I upload videos. If YouTube or Instagram is absolutely necessary for you, at least use the PC
                versions, otherwise delete them. There is absolutely nothing that you are going to miss out on.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Find lower alternatives. If you want to get rid of sugar, eat honey and fruits instead together with
                bitter chocolate, instead of the full portion of sugar. Applied to YouTube, watch TV or podcasts, or at
                least very long videos. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Perspective</h2>

    <p>Now, or parallel, to the process of removing bad habits and distractions you may have noticed how much time got
        free. In that case, set goals. Now, in case you don't know what goals to set, you need to live life to the
        fullest for a few more weeks or months, and experience a lot more boredom, because boredom helps you to think,
        and thinking will do the job for you. Set yourself around 20 different goals. Please note, that if you think you
        can't reach them because you don't deserve them, you need to stop listening to your doubts and trust yourself
        and adjust your belief system. These goals should be just-out-of-reach, in order to maximize results. You can
        even make them time-bound, although I don't recommend doing this, because in most cases, you don't realize your
        full potential.<br>
        Next to getting rid of all your bad habits, there are a few non-negotiables, that you need to prioritize:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sleep<br>If you don't sleep well and enough, you can't function properly.</li>
        <li>Sport<br>If you don't go to the gym, because you have a rest day, at least go for a walk. I go for a walk
            every single morning at 5 am, even on weekends. Often, I see the sunrise and it's very beautiful. Walks
            and sports provide stimulation, and therefore replace any social media and are good for your long-term
            health.</li>
        <li>Meditation<br>Similar to sports, meditation lets your mind rest.</li>
        <li>Constant learning and challenges</li>
        <li>Religion<br>I know that this is controversial in the 21st century, but without God, you can't be happy,
            because you will get overwhelmed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Base activity</h2>

    <p>Before these changes occurred in your life, where you started to break free from bad habits and replaced them
        with good ones, you probably turned on your phone to distract yourself from boredom. During the cut-out phase,
        you slowly replaced it with other activities, but still, your conditioned actions to grab your phone have not
        gotten away. Replace this base activity with reading. Without reading I wouldn't be able to create such essays.
        Reading is valuable because it opens the door to further knowledge and eventually wisdom. Reading will help to
        fill in any missing puzzle pieces in this essay and will provide you with details and surprising findings.</p>

    <h2>The task with the highest return</h2>

    <p>This tutorial goes further than just fixing your life, it goes as far as transforming it completely. Let's
        suppose your goals include becoming a YouTuber, what is the most significant task? Recording videos. If you want
        to become a programmer, what is the most significant task? Programming. If you want to become a cook, what is
        the most significant task? Cooking. It's that simple! Focus on these things instead of distracting yourself
        constantly and everything will work out.</p>

    <p>In practice, no more than 20% percent of your time will ever be allocated to a single most important task,
        because as a YouTuber you need to edit videos, as a programmer you need to test your code, and as a cook, you
        need to clean the kitchen. </p>

    <p>The rest, 80% percent of the time, mostly consist of filler tasks, and always will. It's a myth that some work 16
        hours a day because no one really works more than 3 hours per day, even if your shift lasts 8 hours. The rest of
        the time, the other 13 hours contain as little as 20% of your total daily output, assuming a 16-hour work shift.
        If you work less, your productivity won't decrease much, but simply remember that working constantly has very
        little impact on the rest of your productivity. I learned this in the hardest possible way in 2023. Focus on
        work and work hard instead of working a lot!</p>

    <h2>Accelerate</h2>

    <p>Now, let's say you have removed distractions, removed bad habits, replaced them with good once, set goals, and
        know what to work on, now imagine doing that for 70 years.</p>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

    <p>This way of life will make your life feel much worse than a lot better for a few months and then it will feel as
        if it has always been that way, because only improvement, the difference matters, as taught in the introduction.
        But even if, over the long term you won't feel changes that much anymore, your life will be filled with much
        less regret and pain later. Ultimately, it's worth it because it is the only way to live life, a life with
        constant improvement and learning. </p>

    <p>I can feel a slight insecurity, that's why here is one last thought. Let's suppose you never got rid of all of
        your bad habits and replaced them with good ones, where would your life be in 1, 5, 10, or 70 years compared to
        the completion of your journey? Which life would be less painful and with less regret?</p>
