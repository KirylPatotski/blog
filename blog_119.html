    <h1>Making decisions</h1>

    <p><strong><em>Indecision is deadly.</em></strong> If we ignore the relative nature of virtue and distance ourselves
        from our too-complex world, we find ourselves in the ideal world where good and evil exist in their pure forms.
        So, when good and evil exist, what is the worst kind of evil possible? To skip the process of deduction, the
        worst kind of evil is betrayal, as it obliterates every fundament. If a loved one betrays you, you've got no
        home anymore, you are at the very beginning again, and your little world of safety collapses. You don't know who
        you are yourself anymore and you don't understand anything. Everything that made sense no longer does, now
        people are no longer equal to their words. There is nothing you can do to prepare yourself and no matter how
        competent you are as a person; you can't protect yourself. Betrayal is worse than power without compassion, as
        it's a lot more certain, and power without compassion is often the result of a lack of trust, caused by the
        constant fear of being stabbed in the back, i.e. betrayed. However, betrayal can have some counters, especially
        if you are the more powerful one. You can make there is mutual benefit and surrounding yourself with people you
        can blindly trust helps as well. In practice, there are also a few warning signs to look for. But since evil has
        a counter, which is the good, the worst evil is not the biggest problem. The biggest problem must lie somewhere
        else. The individual frequently encounters it; not knowing what one wants with razor atom-splitting precision.
        There is no inherent counter to indecision and the attached stupidity if you don't know what you want. In your
        life you have time and you have to use this time to work on something, but what should you work on, if you don't
        know what to fancy? How are you supposed to enter a relationship, if you don't what personality the other person
        must have, or desire a personality type that hasn't worked out in the past?¹ Indecision is one of the key
        contributors to mental suffering. If you have a bunch of energy inside yourself and have nowhere to exert it as
        you are unable to make decisions, this energy will be expressed as weakness, for instance in the form of
        procrastination, overthinking, laziness, worries, a lack of mindfulness, and in some cases a mild depression.
        You shut down, as you find yourself to be unable to execute anything. You want to distract yourself and the
        decision gets more dragging. You feel a certain disgust towards yourself and sometimes you dig yourself so deep
        into the thinking that you can't leave your little prison. All of that because you find yourself to be too weak
        to make decisions. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Most decisions are insignificant. The four categories.</em></strong> There are a few decisions and
        let me rank them with their importance. </p>

    <ol>
        <li><em><strong>Irreversible and life-changing.</strong></em> The first and most important category is
            irreversible and permanent. The most important decisions are which woman to pick and which God to follow.
            Some smaller irreversible decisions are for example how many children to have, certainly, you can't reverse
            this. You may think that divorce is possible and marriage can be reverted, but in reality, it can't. It may
            be the lesser evil, but still, it will ruin everyone involved and create damage impossible to repair,
            especially if there are children. This final stage is so abstract that giving general advice here is
            impossible.</li>
        <li><em><strong>Long lasting and important.</strong></em> Then, the second kind of decisions are what to study,
            which job to take, what country to live in, which house to buy, or what business to start. Those can't be
            reverted easily, they take a lot of time and resources and will massively shape who you are as a person, if
            not define who you are and how you want to be perceived. They often require massive sacrifices.</li>
        <li><em><strong>Short-lasting and reversible.</strong></em> Then, the fourth category of decisions are those
            that affect weeks or months, for example, which project to follow, which city to move to, which internship
            to take, or who to fall in love with. Those decisions are important enough for you to remember them your
            entire life, but they can be reverted more or less easily - they aren't permanent. For example, if a project
            fails, simply start a new one, if your relationship doesn't work out, get a new one and when two months are
            over your internship will be over anyway. </li>
        <li><em><strong>Trivial.</strong></em> The least impactful decisions are those most frequent, for example, what
            to do in a said evening, what to eat, or whether you want to read. You must never think about these, if you
            want to read, just do it. Create routines, create plans, and establish deadlines. Get used to making
            decisions to become better at the skill of deciding. It's better to have a bad plan than it is to have no
            because you can simply improve your plans and routines over time and master this skill. Doing so will make
            you respect yourself and remove that drag you have inside of yourself, such as procrastination or worries.
            Most decisions change nothing, thus, get used to making them.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Generally, you get better at decision-making when you know more.</p>

    <p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br></p>

    <p><strong><em>Tests and mainstream advice just don't work.</em></strong> Some crappy-guru advice would go as
        follows. 'Write down 25 of the most important memories you have and see how they relate to your future
        profession.' I can tell you, I'm living a very extreme life with constant action everywhere and even I wouldn't
        be able to come up with 25 moments that changed my life, my life isn't interesting enough for that and I can't
        expect yours to be more interesting. Also, random personality tests won't work, no matter how detailed they are,
        they won't aid you in the decision of what to study or which profession to pick. If your decision isn't about
        what profession to pick, but rather which woman, then looking at tests for personality types or temperaments
        won't work either, tests just don't work - life would be very predictable if they did. As if reality is that
        simple. </p>

    <p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br></p>

    <p>Now that you have learned the problems stemming from indecisions, such as worries, also that most decisions are
        irrelevant, and to make more important decisions, get used to making smaller ones. We will not focus on
        irrelevant decisions in this text, as you can just make them. This text is about those that are brutally hard to
        make. Mainly, which profession to pick or field to study and which woman to pick. So, when you have to make an
        important decision…</p>

    <p><strong><em>Go in yourself.</em></strong> I want you to do nothing for two days. If two days aren't enough, take
        a few sick days, I promise it's worth it. I want you to do absolutely nothing. No internet, no phone, no sweets,
        no walks, no social interactions, no 'exciting' food (anything outside of rice, oats, bread, or potatoes), no
        music, no warm water. Instead, lie in bed as if you were sick with immense discipline. You need to bore yourself
        to hell and everything beyond this step will come automatically. If just lying around becomes too boring, take a
        pencil and a piece of paper and write down your thoughts. Meditate. </p>

    <p><em>“Meditation is very simple. You start to focus on something, preferably your breath, and try to think about
            nothing else. You will notice your mind wandering again eventually, and then you simply refocus. Refocusing
            again is like doing mental pushups, you don't need to be angry for losing focus, because that's progress! Do
            this for 15 minutes every day for the rest of your life and your life quality will improve immensely. Remove
            distractions for a higher speed and limit perspective to focus with full force.” </em>- text #91</p>

    <p>This method works so well that I could end this text right here. It works so well because you give your mind the
        time to think and boredom always brings a creativity spike, for example, I've been able to write 39,700 words in
        20 days after doing <em>nothing</em> for 2 days. After this boring phase, you will also gain the desire to do
        things, especially if you maintain the gained discipline and realize how little you miss getting messages from
        others. Also, dare to use your understanding, it's your life and you have to listen to yourself. Cut out the
        opinions of other people for a while. Another effect this method may bring is that you may develop a crush on
        someone or lose the crush you have. That's because this approach is very radical and brings higher levels of
        consciousness, as it rips you out of your typical routines. It's easy to be sunk in tasks and duties, i.e.
        school, work, or household, but being sunk in duties doesn't require consciousness and therefore your mind
        effectively turns off. That's also the reason why this repetitive lifestyle makes discipline so hard and
        procrastination so easy, as your consciousness is turned off. If that sounds strange, trust me on that, I've
        done it three times already. The first time, ten days in June 2023, I recovered from my burnout, the second time
        in October 2023 I recovered from mental turmoil caused by heart matters and another smaller burnout, and in
        December 2023 I recovered from a very hopeless, sad, unconscious and emotionless, almost depressive phase… This
        method also heals wounds in the soul and body, as you lie in bed as if you were sick. I promise that just two
        days will be more than enough, if not just use a few more. Time is going to pass anyway. Maybe you will also
        hesitate to bore yourself because of what if may reveal, thus it becomes even more important. <em>Give your mind
            time
            to think about things.</em></p>


    <p><strong><em>Desexualize.</em></strong> The first step to making a good decision may surprise you and not a lot of
        people are disciplined enough to execute this step and succumb to their desires instead. I want to share that if
        you talk of someone of the opposite sex or even consider doing so, no matter how little you perceive the
        attraction to be, it occupies something close to 60% of your entire mind, especially of your subconscious. Even
        looking at women while going on your daily walk is harmful if you have to make an important decision as it
        distracts you far too much. That's the reason many great inventors or other brilliant minds stayed celibate
        their entire lives. Even checking messages on your phone creates problems and tenfold the damage is created if
        you open social media or meet in person. Controlling your sexual desire is not very easy but very simple. Sit
        upright with your shoulders back and breathe deeply. Your subconscious is constantly thinking and looking for
        solutions, do not make it think about sex in or representations thereof, make it think about the decision you
        want to make. Learn to take control of your mind, and learn to resist impulses. If you learn to resist your
        sexual desire, you will learn to control every other aspect of your life. Another aspect of desexualization is
        that it establishes a new level of existence, one where you feel as if you are the lord of your house and live
        life accordingly, challenges become fun. If you have little discipline, fight hard, it's of vital importance, at
        least for a few days. Challenges and problems for your mind to solve you will have more than enough. Now you may
        think to have a crush on someone and I can tell you from experience, that no matter how severe the crush, with
        enough mind control you can learn to unthink about that person by doing pushups whenever you get the thought to
        create a strong negative conditioned link. Just disregard those thoughts as you would with meditation. I noticed
        that it works and when you see her in person again you don't think of anything and just feel attracted… <em>Give
            your mind the capacity to think.</em></p>


    <p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br></p>

    <p><strong><em>Can you get in a flow with the truth you are trying to ignore?</em></strong> You may know that I'm
        not seeking to be inclusive in my speech. I often express myself harshly (maybe too harshly) but here it's of
        use. Harsh expressions are necessary if you look purely at the actions and not the intentions. Intentions don't
        matter too much, actions do, because e.g. a job consists primarily of doing. So, we will apply the same
        technique here as well. We will not look at intentions, but at what one will do, which constitutes an a priori
        way of thinking, the action matters more than the result. Of course, jobs are more complex, but one must not
        lose the core in the sea of details. For example, medicine sounds noble, until you realize that the daily task;
    </p>

    <p><em>“I want to get in a flow while smelling blood and while cutting flesh. I want to study for ten years to
            neglect my future family just to get an even more exhausting job. I enjoy the hospital's piercing
            smell and its depressive interior design.” - Medicine </em></p>

    <p><em>“I want to be viewed as useless by everyone and linger in a university my entire life desperately worrying
            about life's meaning and I fancy to peak at reading books and writing texts while having little money. All I
            want to do is think and learn without ever implementing anything, I want to die as a virgin.” -
            Philosopher</em></p>

    <p><em>“I want everyone to know intricate details about my life and I essentially want to live just to collect
            lessons, constantly fearing that I will burn out and starve.” - Writer </em></p>

    <p><em>“I want to wipe the stinking asses of ungrateful, annoying, and loud children. Wiping kid's asses brings me a
            flow and I want to do that for the rest of my life. At least, children are cute and bring energy into my
            life” - Kindergarten</em></p>

    <p><em>“I want to be regarded as a complete loser by everyone and spend my time on the internet only, as I want to
            be a programmer. I don't care that programming has terrible mental and physical health consequences and
            repels the opposite sex. But, what does one need that for, if there is the internet and some intricate
            math.” - Programmer</em></p>

    <p><em>“I want to be fully dependent on my state and have no say in anything and I get in a real flow while dealing
            with asocial parents arguing their righteousness for raising their neglected stupid children. I also get in
            a flow while reading the stupid things students write down.” - Teacher</em></p>

    <p><em>“I want a life where I have not a single free moment, I want to have no time to take a deep breath and
            constantly worry about me getting metaphorically stabbed.” - Entrepreneur</em></p>

    <p>One could think of many more examples, but you get the point. Do not get lost in the details, look at your daily
        task and assess whether you can get in a flow with it. For example, I can't get in a flow while analyzing wounds
        in a stinking depressive hospital, hence I can't become a doctor. I know that my summaries are offensively
        ignorant of the bigger picture, but the point is to not forget what you will need to get in a flow with. You
        must be utterly honest with yourself about it. Consider how the job will smell, look, and feel. Look at the
        problems, not the rewards. Look at the sacrifices, not on the salary. The rewards for each job are fairly
        similar, but the price is a different one. Every job can bring status, freedom, and money. When it comes to
        relationships, I recommend doing the same; can you enter a flow with the person you are talking to? Do you want
        to smell, see, and feel that person every day? What are you willing to sacrifice, what are you willing to do? Do
        not forget the core in the sea of details.</p>

    <p><strong><em>It's not too different.</em></strong> Regardless of what career you pick, remember that the choice of
        who to marry or which God to believe in is more important. If you sit in an office filling out documents as a
        clerk, entrepreneur, or doctor makes little difference. The difference between a blonde girl and a brunette
        isn't too big either. Having lived in a German village and the Belarusian capital, two cities that could not be
        more different, I can tell you that it's the same everywhere. You adapt much better than you think. That means,
        you can enter learn to get in a flow with something, especially if you don't know what brings you in the flow so
        far. If you do a job for long enough or spend enough time with a woman, you are likely to get in harmony with
        each other, so do not worry; master something for it to bring fulfillment. Programming didn't let me enter a
        flow and neither did writing, I just continued it for so long that I could focus for up to ten hours without
        even going to the toilet once. Become good at something to determine whether you want to master it.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Do not fight your will.</em></strong> But, if you realize that you can't be in harmony with the work
        or the woman, remember that it's better to adapt early than it is to wait because waiting will become more
        expensive by the minute. Of course, I could learn to enter a flow, for example with text translation, but it
        would not bring my life any deeper meaning. </p>

    <p><em>“You may be tempted to think that you are in control of your thoughts, dreams, or desires. But the presence
            thereof demonstrates precisely that some other power exists within yourself. You may name it how you want.
            You can't make yourself interested in something or someone, it just comes naturally, no matter how hard you
            try, you can't change what you are passionate about and what brings you in the flow. All have such desires
            commanding the will and fighting against that will leads to a price too expensive to pay, a lost battle in
            the fight for a meaningful life. If you know that you are excellent at writing and it brings you in the
            flow, it's better to do just that, even though it may bring little income, compared to trying to suppress
            this desire. There is a whole series of mental disorders and most of them stem from you knowing that you
            aren't doing what you should be doing, i.e. your mind, body, intellect, and life are not in harmony. Because
            your sanity is at risk, don't fight against your will, or if you do, prepare yourself for months of
            depression! Good luck with moving on! You didn't choose this will but trying to think it away won't bring
            anything, you must follow it or pay the price. God decided that and you are powerless.“ - text 117</em></p>


    <p><strong><em>What are you doing right now, what do you obsess over?</em></strong> I write all day long. So, that
        makes deciding already a lot easier. But I know that I'm a capable programmer and writer, so I have those two
        options. In essence, if you do something all day long anyway, consider that as your profession. If you are doing
        nothing all day long, I want you to try out many things. Apply to as many internships as possible. For example,
        as I child, science fascinated me, but trying out an internship when I was 15 established the certainty that I
        didn't want to have anything to do with science in my life. If you are hesitant about what to study, apply to
        both, try them out, and decide then. But, I'm going to tell you something interesting; when it truly comes to
        the moment of the decision, you will realize that you made a choice already long ago, and one of the options
        will establish itself to be your favorite because your mind will keep thinking. Try out things and in between
        trying out things, take intense rest days to give your mind time to process it! </p>

    <p><strong><em>Thinking thirty years ahead.</em></strong> To make things easier for your children, I want you to
        invest a day's salary. Buy them random cheap interesting objects, such as a compass or books. For example, when
        I was seven, I developed a passion for nuclear energy because I read it in a book and didn't know what “atom”
        meant. Now, after puberty started, I was split between entrepreneurship and something like a scientist. Yet, an
        internship at a laboratory when I was 15 determined that I never wanted anything to do with physics in my life
        ever again. My parents could not have known that I would develop a distaste for science despite it being
        propagated aggressively to me for more than a decade. So, don't think that developing your children will bias
        them. Simply develop your children to make their lives more fulfilling. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Purpose.</em></strong> I don't want this text to turn into a massive one, but your job should align
        with the answer to the question of what you want to get out of life. One must ask what one is living for. Don't
        be hesitant to change everything about how you live and who you are. Be willing to change everything. You won't
        regret it. Do not resist a shift of purpose, resisting will only bring suffering. Sacrifice where it is
        necessary. Commitment and sacrifice refer to the same thing. Never will you regret letting go. Fulfillment is
        the goal. Purpose is doubtlessly the most important thing in one's life. A person with a why can bear almost
        every how. Don't know your purpose? Discover it, by staring at the wall until you find it! If you live a life
        aligned to your purpose you will realize how great life can be. Especially if you align your religion, woman,
        and studies/profession with it. Otherwise, you will keep stagnating in life, stuck in indecision. </p>

    <p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br></p>

    <p>Life is defined as the fight against the universe's indifference. There are two forces in life, one called life
        and the other one called death, the force that accelerates and the force that slows. There is the force that
        repairs and the forces that constantly destroy. There is a force that makes birds fly but also one that makes
        stones lay on the ground. There is a force that stops every exponential process by removing perfection. There is
        a force that makes even the worst evil, betrayal, forgivable and it's the force of the universe's indifferent
        complexity. While one force accelerates, there is an array of forces that stop and they are all intertwined in
        ways impossible to grasp. The slowing force only exists in the presence of an accelerating force. However, life
        is always trying to stay alive, hence, the slowing force is always there, in an equilibrium. That's why time is
        always against you, it will slow you down and push the equilibrium against you. So, by being active, fast, and
        competent you get to turn the forces in your favor, by accelerating strong enough you will prevent coming to a
        deadly halt. Indecision is the embodiment of you slowing yourself down while the universe's indifference is
        slowing you down already, so your energy becomes the wrong one. Attack life. Accept that you will never be
        ready. You will only be ready after you've done it. Never does waiting work. Create, don't react. Do what you
        know you should be doing as much as you can, you don't need to go all in just now. But for example, for me,
        writing one hour a day is almost always possible. But most hesitancy is a sign of a lack of consciousness and
        discipline. Accept that you cannot change anything except yourself. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Notes from February 8th, 2024.</strong> On January 20th I was driven to a mountain and I failed to
            conquer it. It was getting dark, the snow was too deep, my sister's bike failed, I underestimated the
            mountain and it was cold. I rode my bike back having failed, despite being driven with my bike by car 90% of
            the way to the mountain. - a total embarrassment... I decided not to accept defeat, so I wanted to try again
            in the winter holidays. Today, Thursday, after a math exam in school I decided that I'm not going to wait
            for pretty weather and neither am I going to wait till the holidays. So, I went on a random school day, with
            rainy (snowy in the mountains) weather, knowing that the distance was my edge. I rode my bike there, it took
            me two hours (~18km, +600m). The final bit was getting too steep and snowy to ride and was also hard on
            foot. I almost gave up and pushed a bit harder. The brakes on my sister's bike stopped working on the way
            down, so I walked. A total of 35km, 5 hours. Frozen, hungry, thirsty, wet, and covered in snow, I returned.
            By that point, it was already completely dark and it had rained for two hours. For the first time, I
            conquered this mountain and leaned beyond my edge. I did not wait for anything and just took control of my
            life. </em></p>

    <p>¹Don't care if my love who supposedly does not love me back reads this, but I have an insight that I got through
        pure reason after she rejected me in June. She is not a loser, I'm an absolute winner, and I know hardly any
        winners, so option one would be that she lied about being taken. The second logical deduction is that she must
        have a terrible relationship because she took a loser and is not a loser herself. Turns out, logical thinking
        was correct because the latter was confirmed. Hence, if she thinks that I have the wrong personality type
        because her dream type is, by all regards, a loser, just like those she spends time with, she shall be
        responsible herself. That's the typical example of not knowing what one wants. Don't know if she has the insight
        to see that. Hopefully, ...
