    <h1>The manipulator</h1>

    <p><strong><em>The thing that makes people helpless.</em></strong> After the creation of the world, the biblical
        story continues with humans living in a perfect world, a paradise. The word paradise means “walled garden”, it
        contains order, safety, and comfort through the embodiment of the protective isolating wall and it also has an
        element of waiting chaos in it, the garden, which resembles chaos, i.e. tamed nature. Normally this nature is
        dangerous and complicated without ends. In this little world, everything works alright as long as the walls
        stand, the nature within the garden remains tamed and no serpents are awaiting - of course, until there are.
        Interestingly, if one were to look it up in the dictionary, 'serpent' is synonymous with 'traitor' and 'snake'.
        In the bible, the serpent tempts the naïve woman to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, as she
        would then become more God-like herself. Of course, the woman ruins the life of her man by convincing him to eat
        from this tree too, instead of the tree of life that brought prosperity and secured paradise. As the woman and
        man eat from the tree of knowledge between good and evil, they gain consciousness and realize their nakedness -
        literally and metaphorically. Consequently, their little walled garden gets taken away and they enter the
        chaotic infinitely complex real world. Suddenly, they are mortal and live lives of scarcity and danger.
        Suddenly, the pleasant little world that once was collapsed and revealed its full complexity. The fall of the
        metaphorical wall enabled the emergence of hostility from ambush. Now every tamed plant in the garden turned
        into one where a poisonous spider could emerge. As the walls were gone, one must constantly fear skirmishes.
        Hitherto you knew what to do, but now every certainty is gone, what should you do about your nakedness? You are
        completely helpless. </p>

    <p><strong><em>The worst kind of evil.</em></strong> Dante Alighieri, the Italian poet from the 13th and 14th
        centuries, asked himself in his work “Inferno” what constitutes the worst kind of evil. There are nine levels to
        hell, nine levels as to what evil essence is. The first stage of hell is for pagans, the second stage is for
        those who succumb to their sexual desire, and the third stage is for fat people, for those who can't get enough.
        The fourth stage is for wasteful and greedy people and the fifth stage is for people filled with wrath. So far,
        those things are not the worst, because they are limited in their scope. The sixth stage is for those preaching
        false ideals - able to destroy entire societies. The seventh stage of hell is power without compassion, i.e.
        violence. The eighth stage is for fraud and the final level, the ninth, the lowest one is for traitors. Now you
        may be wondering as to why traitors are the worst kind of evil. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Power without compassion has weak points.</em></strong> Well, it's simple. Power without compassion
        is one of the worst things that exist, but one can at least prepare or if nothing works violently resist. You
        know, what about utilitarianism… Also, because pure forms of good and evil don't exist, power without compassion
        offers some points from which it can be exploited and removed, e.g. if there is an excess thereof, people will
        fight as they will have nothing to lose. That's why we have in our world currently not too many examples that
        have survived for a long time. If one is too cruel, one will not find many friends and one will get removed.
    </p>

    <p><strong><em>Yet, there is nothing one can do against betrayal,</em></strong> it can come from everywhere at any
        time from everyone. Brutal authority is often even used because of the fear of betrayal, every dictator fears
        getting their back stabbed. No matter how powerful a person may seem, they aren't immune to betrayal. How did
        Ceaser die…? Betrayal is especially dangerous as it's only possible if the person is important to you, for
        example, if you authentically love your wife and see her with another man. Suddenly, everything collapses and
        nothing makes sense anymore, you don't know how you were able to be fooled and you don't know the other person
        anymore… You no longer have a home, just a house. The walled garden with tamed nature collapsed and the world is
        now chaotic without an end. Returning to the example of authoritarianism, i.e. power without compassion, one can
        easily see that authority is order which tries to counter the chaos that betrayal creates. That means
        authoritarianism is the force that tries hard to prevent betrayal and makes its entire point of existence, it
        tries hard to avoid it. In authoritarianism, there is little trust, as trust enables one to be betrayed in the
        first place. Life under an iron fist is horrible. Visualize you not being sure who in your own family can snitch
        on you. Never trusting anyone doesn't work either, though authoritarianism tries to do that, because trusting no
        one creates weak points one could exploit, and trust is what glues people together. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Trust makes life simpler. </em></strong> There are several axioms people think of themselves, and one
        of them is that we are generally good. Because we think to ourselves that we are good, we hold our word or at
        least try to do so, as we know that it makes life simpler for everyone. We all have a shadow side, yet, for
        comfort's sake, we try to hide it so that the walls of safety to our little worlds don't collapse. Trust is one
        of the most valuable resources, also from an economic perspective. Brands try to establish a good name so more
        people buy from them. Internet trade is a miracle, people trust each other enough not to send broken products
        and bouncing checks, despite never having seen each other. Most things in a society work on trust, not only
        economics, it goes as deep as one's personality. Conscientiousness, i.e. thinking ahead and preparing oneself
        only makes sense if one trusts the world. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Traitors aren't always evil. </em></strong> But then, there are traitors, those that exploit the
        axiom of mutual trust. Most of the time, people don't betray due to their evilness, they betray because they
        want to keep their walled garden blossoming themselves, even if it means watering the roses with blood. If your
        wife is cheating, it is more likely that she lacks conscientiousness than that she is evil. If one doesn't
        follow what one promised to God, one is not inherently with a frozen heart, but rather lacking discipline. If
        one is a traitor, for example in a war, one can even argue that those traitors are, in their sense, good, as
        they bring the end of the war a lot closer with fewer casualties. If one steals, one may do it out of
        desperation. That means reality is complex enough to make the worst kind of evil forgivable to an extent.</p>

    <p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><br><br><br>*****<br><br><br></p>


    <p><strong><em>Manipulation is betrayal, but with a darker twist, it is treason without the other person even
                noticing it.</em></strong> That means, not only does the walled garden collapse but the other person
        doesn't even have enough capacity to realize that the walls have fallen. Putting it this way makes manipulation
        sound as if it's even worse than betrayal. But here lies the unexpected twist, manipulation is in nine out of
        ten cases positive. Manipulation itself is evil because of its subtle nature, you get to change people to follow
        your will, which is often positive.</p>

    <p><strong><em>In 16 years of life, one can learn a lot,</em></strong> including how to manipulate. I have a pair of
        eyes that can see right through almost every person I encounter. I can instantly recognize whether there is
        something off with the person and whether they are a backstabber and I've never misjudged anyone, if I get to
        know such a person further, I notice how correct I am, and not only because of the bias created by the first
        impression. If something is off about the person the first time you look them in the eyes, it's virtually
        impossible to be genuine. Texts #104 and #28 go into great detail with this specific aspect. If you can see
        through people with a gaze that penetrates, it gives you an invaluable advantage. I learned this because I've
        lived a life that's a bit extraordinary. However, being able to see through people in an instant with unexpected
        precision makes people raise eyebrows - they will think that you are the manipulator. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Others may doubt who I am.</em></strong> In my situation, it makes sense why people may think I'm
        manipulating exorbitantly. For example, a few days ago I went to the highest mountain in my area and biked
        beyond my normal capacity. But, what proof can others have, except a picture that could be fake and the
        different pair of shoes I wore the next day? Why did I not show any signs of exhaustion the next days despite
        moving beyond my baseline? Who is supposed to believe that I biked there on a day that's a normal school day
        with rain included? This is just one example. I'm living an unbelievable life to most and they have little to
        verify how I live. It makes it no better that I laugh hard at jokes centered around reality and manipulation.
        For example, I laughed for a solid five minutes after a friend of mine told me that she sent our friend her
        school notes. Knowing that I love reality and the truth, she added that she could have lied about everything,
        every conspectus and note she ever sent and no one would know. I laughed so hard I teared up; I found the
        imagination that one's entire reality could be a lie very amusing. On a bigger scale, what else is fake without
        us ever finding out? Our entire reality could be a complete lie… Even after reciting that one could have faked
        an entire reality to a classmate, I found it no less amusing! That was on Friday, the 9th of February, and the
        thought that I could be lying about everything infected me…</p>

    <p><strong><em>Doubting oneself.</em></strong> I suddenly started to doubt who I was as a person and the life I'm
        living. Listening to the things I talk about it's irrational to assume that they are true, which person gets up
        at 3:00 or 3:30 to write a text full of concepts seemingly completely out of my reach? I also know that some
        aspects of my personality are misleading. I try hard with everything I do, which could mean that some could
        severely overestimate me, I've never run longer than 10 km and needed 5 hours to bike/hike 36 km on the said
        Thursday (maybe my baseline needs a lot of growth, to be fair, I started training only a year ago). Sure, I
        practiced, speaking but still, I stutter occasionally. I'm confident in excess and still am nervous around my
        love, even if it's invisible. I claim to be religious, yet today I didn't pray in the morning. So in principle,
        this text is a little confession… I claim to be a good cook and as my friends visited me on Friday they agreed,
        yet before that I hadn't cooked anything for something like a year or so. Since I can see right through people,
        I could bend my personality to suit it, yet I don't, which could be interpreted as an extraordinary way of
        manipulation. I also can control my feelings and my mind easily, which could make me seem untrustworthy. I can
        control my emotions, speech, and body to such an extent that no one ever noticed who I loved in school and even
        the people reading my blog couldn't identify the person I'm talking about - that's how competent I am at
        obfuscation. I don't know how I'm perceived. I have the sharpest senses, yet wear glasses; I remember
        everything, yet don't know what the next lesson in my timetable is… I started to doubt how much is real about
        myself and that me question who I am further. If I'm the greatest manipulator of all because of my precise
        judgment and high intelligence, how should anyone be able to trust me? Maybe I'm a fraud… But, thinking that I'm
        a manipulator doesn't bring anyone anywhere, most of it is just a hallucination from the brain. I don't think
        I'm untrustworthy or perceived as such. But, I know that this doubt is universal and normal to have temporarily
        - everyone knows themselves pretty well, especially if they don't want to admit it.</p>

    <p><strong><em>I do manipulate actively.</em></strong> I don't hide that I'm trying to change people I'm around all
        the time. What is this blog truly about? For example, I've thrashed into at least three people to sit upright,
        as that's what an alpha would do. What else I thrashed into; I don't know. And here is where it gets
        fascinating, I never adopt the thinking patterns of others, as I pay a lot of attention when others try to
        influence me. For example, most people try to indoctrinate into me that it's ok to be a loser and that I'm
        overdoing everything. Other people try to thrash in that I must listen to women, which never did any good to me.
        I change only when I'm convinced the other person could be right. One could interpret the entire essay
        collection as a way to plan radical opinions subtly into you. I control what you think this very instance. There
        are many tactics I use that resemble cults, for example, I make you feel superior and half of my texts say that
        everyone is wrong and I'm right. I'm trying to change you and everyone else and it works. I also know that
        people like to be seduced. Without seduction, the human race would go extinct. Often, the line between serving
        and betraying is thin. Dying your hair is doubtlessly manipulation and can seduce, but is it betrayal? Not
        really. Editing photos is manipulation, the software I use is called “gnu image manipulation program”. But where
        is the border between making a photo more 'attractive' and making it a fraud? </p>

    <p><strong><em>I act real at all times.</em></strong> And precisely acting real is what can make one doubt the
        authenticity, as it makes a lie much better hidden. One could argue that if I act always real, then a lie must
        be real too, which is frankly another useless belief one can get while doubting oneself. I claim to value
        morals, yet how are you supposed to know what I really value, what if my authenticity could be a lie? Now, I can
        relax you a bit, because I do view morality and virtue as central; The point of martial arts is to become such
        competent a fighter that no one will desire to fight against you. Martial arts make you discover your shadow and
        learn to handle it. I'm able to manipulate, and precisely because I'm able to, I don't. If you want to gain
        wisdom you have to look where the biggest darkness lies, the truth you least want to confront, you have to
        integrate your shadow, otherwise it will come out in a way much worse. Would I ever betray? No, because I know
        enough myself especially about my shadow to a point where so much light shines on it that it's no longer dark. I
        think it's better to be hung for loyalty than to get a golden nugget for betrayal, though I admit to not knowing
        whether I would be strong enough to stay true to my words. So, am I a fraud? No, but one could easily think so,
        as I'm capable of it. Yes, the doubt of my authenticity has some reasons but is largely a mental illusion. Yes,
        being inauthentic, lying, and betraying are evil, and yes, knowing how to do these things and not doing them is
        pure good.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Innocent child.</em></strong> Some people are incapable of manipulation or betrayal. At least that's
        what they think, because they won't dare to discover their shadow. Yet, do you know what this text is truly
        about? I know that one can only go to heaven if one is as naïve as a child, one must have a pure soul. Yet, when
        one is naïve, one will get pushed around and bring excessive misery to those around him. The ideal human does
        not attempt to change others, is open, is never offended, warm, humble, giving, and is an idealist. And there is
        a term for this type of person - 'idiot'. You see, being perfect in your character does not mean you can live
        the optimal life, everyone will take advantage of you. You have to become a monster and then learn how to handle
        it. Know yourself. There is no redemption without a free will. And don't forget to trust others to be trusted,
        naïveté makes you more trustworthy, especially if others also know that you can become a dangerous person! I
        know deep in my heart that I'm real, so I do not worry about what others think of me too much. That's how you
        defeat this self-doubt; by being authentic. I know that I'm not of evil intent, that I don't lie, steal, or
        manipulate negatively and I know that others trust me, as I trust them. God always knows when you are or aren't
        genuine.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Lie once and you are never to be trusted again, now you are no longer equal to your
                word.</em></strong></p>
