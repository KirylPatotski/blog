    <h1>Returning on the right path</h1>

    <p><em><strong>On the 25th of March.</strong></em> I don't feel like writing this text. I have zero motivation and
        inspiration to write it and I do it anyway. I slept in late instead of getting up early and working hard. I sat
        with a curvy back and didn't use any of my time productively in the morning either. For 14 days I messed up
        writing my diary and this isn't even the first time, I missed it so often that practically every day since
        January is poked. I struggled to get hard workouts in the gym, I was weak to myself. I was mentally slow and
        wasted practically all of my time. You know, school ended at 12:30 and when was I home? 13:40 - I live 7 minutes
        away from the school. Fair enough, I spent some time with a friend, but then, what did I do from 13:40 - 15:40?
        Two hours for nothing. I did nothing when I came back, I didn't even use the internet or waste time on bad
        habits, therefore I don't know where the time went. Now it's 15:50. The only thing I did was a brutal 10-minute
        workout and frying some meat in parallel, that took 10 minutes. Where did the rest of the time go? I don't buy
        into the crap of 'not every second can be productive' - it seems, I was unconscious. In these two hours, I could
        have written 2400 words, completed a brutal workout with a run, biked a marathon or if all failed, I could have
        watched a movie. What did I do? Nothing. I don't want to live like that, where time just passes, you hesitate
        and split attention all the time and get nothing done. Where did two hours go? </p>

    <p><em><strong>I declined for six months.</strong></em> Not only in the past two hours did I struggle with this
        problem. Ever since I lost my strong, first purpose of programming I struggled to fill the time, which was six
        months ago. With writing and videos, there is just too much free time, hence, you end up wasting it on hedonism
        and depression, I tried multiple times to just force myself to do things and to stop being so unconscious and
        undisciplined, but all for practically nothing. Despite knowing that I was able to previously just push myself.
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>You will experience the same, whether you like it or not.</strong></em> You will go through this
        phase and I have to tell you that any attempt at restoring discipline too early with brute force won't work
        unless you are under unbelievable pressure, which rarely happens after the end of a purpose. You will be a
        little hedonist at that time, if there is no strong enough why then everything becomes hard. And since you will
        be a little hedonist, there will be some nights when you will crush your self-image and be ashamed of yourself.
        You will hate yourself, and the worst thing about this hate is that you may still not be strong enough to use
        that energy that comes from shame effectively. When you hate yourself and feel down, when you have fallen, what
        do you do? When you keep making promises to yourself, don't complete them, set them again, and fail anew, what
        do you do? You will get to a point where you will pray on your knees because you will be in enough pain to do
        so. You are at the bottom and what if you aren't strong enough to climb out of hell?</p>

    <p><em><strong>Vicious circle.</strong></em> Let me tell you something about having a notebook and writing a diary.
        If you miss it, missing it again becomes more likely, and you can spiral downward to skipping to write down
        twenty days, that's what happened to me. The thing is, missing days becomes always easier, and restarting gets
        mentally increasingly more exhausting - you would have to face your lack of discipline. That's a double-death
        spiral. After a while, it becomes a triple-death spiral since without reflection consciousness deteriorates just
        as your productivity, hence, you get less to write about. Not reflecting and documenting brings a wide array of
        issues itself. Every day not reflected is lost. After a while, you consider quitting the diary altogether. Of
        course, you know that you aren't allowed to quit, you very well understand what is right or not. So, you promise
        yourself every day to restart and fail. Every time you crumble a bit of your respect and lose your dignity.
        Furthermore, every time you lie, it becomes easier to keep lying. Issue is: no matter which activity, if you
        miss it, missing it and lying to yourself becomes easier and restarting harder. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Maybe your problem is deeper</strong></em> and not just missing to write your diary. Maybe you've
        gained a new addiction despite being on self-improvement for years. Maybe old cravings started to reappear in
        your lower times. Maybe you've been through much harder times and years into your self-improvement you encounter
        your first depression. It can all happen and will on a long enough frame. Life will throw everything it has in
        its arsenal. </p>

    <p><em><strong>You can climb out of hell in two ways.</strong></em> The first method is to take small steps to climb
        up, even when those are shameful or trivial. The second method is to create an event painful enough so that you
        will catapult out of hell. The fusion would be to start with the event to reset the baseline and then improve
        slowly. I've tried all of them and depending on where you are in life something different will work. But perhaps
        you're too weak to take the second path and would fall back right away, I in my current state am, despite having
        used the second path multiple times. </p>

    <p><em><strong>Let's look at the first path.</strong></em> In the Bible, we find what is now known as the Mattew
        principle. <em>Those who have plentiful more will be given and to those who have nothing more will taken.</em>
        Reality is not linear. If you're a loser, you will be an even worse loser pretty quickly. Nothing changes
        initially, but then it all starts to compound and you reach a cliff - accelerating your decline even further.
        Riding the moped is stupid, nonetheless, everything will go smoothly for a while. Eventually, something will
        happen and if you get <em>unlucky</em>, knowing bloody well how dangerous riding was to begin with, you'll end
        up paralyzed. Now that you're a cripple, you may lose your job, since you can't move effectively. Next, your
        savings run dry because you've probably been reckless in every other area. Next, your relationship deteriorates
        because you have nothing: no income, no use in the household, and no sex. Your health declines rapidly because
        you can't work out. Health damage gets amplified by other former problems. Since you can't work out, you feel
        lethargic, likewise, your mental performance drops. Your mind gets in ruins since you don't experience new
        things and only sit around. First, your actions went without consequences for years since you got lucky your
        moped didn't get run over. Then came the metaphorical or real cliff, the accident, which made me lose everything
        at an increasing pace. The motorbike accident isn't as metaphoric as you might think if you ever talked with
        people, outside of small talk because most won't brag about their stupidity. Certainly, not everyone drives a
        motorbike and not every motorbike accident ends in a catastrophe. However, the principles remain true. Let's
        think bigger. A nation with no money will have corruption and misuse the very little money it has, it won't be
        able to invest in growth effectively. This is one of the vicious circles of poverty. Then, let's scale down
        again. In primary school, the differences between the students are almost nonexistent. A few grades later, the
        differences are visible, but one or the other may still be able to turn his life around. In university, the
        differences likely aren't that great either between the students who hustle on their business and the ones who
        party only. Step by step, the differences become wider and wider. One of them who didn't party becomes a
        billionaire, and the others become nameless, they have little and get even more taken away. - Their decline is
        not visible initially but becomes faster by the day. The compound effect is brutal. But why wait for university
        and adulthood? I can look at myself, I was able to accelerate my development to a point where I have
        legitimately nothing in common with the people around me. Normally it takes a long time for differences to
        compound, but when the difference is already perceivable, it means, their decline is as rapid as my ascend. You
        see, the Mattew principle, or call it compound effect not only applies to declining, but it also applies to
        accelerating. <em>Those who have plentiful more will be given and to those who have nothing more will
            taken.</em> That means, firstly, you see no difference and you see no difference for a long while and wonder
        why you keep sacrificing. Then you start to notice differences and then you gain speed increasingly faster. You
        start working out, you get more energy. You get more energy, and you work and learn harder. You work and learn
        harder, you get rich. You get rich, you get a high-tier woman, and more motivated. You continue working out and
        get stronger and fitter by the day. The upward spiral is just as real as the downward one. So that means,
        success and decline are exponential. First nothing happens for a while and then comes the cliff or mountain.
        Let's turn it around. If first nothing happens and then success accelerates, it means that the steps to success
        can be trivial or shameful. If you genuinely tried you could get up at 3. Yet you wouldn't be able to keep it,
        chances are our states in life differ. Maybe you're a useless degenerate and a collection of bad habits. - Don't
        lie to yourself, otherwise, you will have no starting point. Be humble. So, set yourself an alarm for 3, but 10,
        and never miss it, under any circumstances. Are you able to get up before 10 every day? If not, set the alarm to
        11. Next, can you do 150 pushups per day? No. Can you do just one? If not, can you do one table pushup? - So
        start with that. Next, if running a marathon is too hard, run around your block. If running around your block is
        too hard, <em>walk</em> it. If you struggle to get consistent, take even smaller steps, those will be shameful.
        You already know what to do, don't lie, especially not to yourself. If you do just one pushup a day, never get
        up later the 10 am, and walk the 500 m around your block, you are moving in the right direction and ahead of
        most people already. It doesn't matter how small or even shameful the initial steps toward the right path are,
        what matters more is that you heading in the right direction - the Mattew principle will enable further progress
        faster. If you do one pushup and do it for long enough, you will be doing ten pushups faster than you can blink.
        You will get more energized and confident, which will make you more productive, which will free more time for
        longer walks, which then you catch up or even surpass everyone, you enter the upward spiral. Even if the first
        steps are shamefully trivial and small, take them. </p>

    <p>When God sees you are genuinely trying, you will be given, if not, everything will be taken from you. God wants
        to see his creations making him proud.</p>

    <p><em><strong>The first path is for girls, but you have to start somewhere.</strong></em> It's cute to make
        progress in little steps and to be grateful for the slightest improvement. Chances are, you're a girl or at
        least living like that. If you are a girl according to how you live, use that as a starting level, you can't
        become a man out of nothing. If you aren't a girl or a child, when was the last time you refused to sleep in?
        When was the last time you froze and starved? When was the last time you did something brave or something where
        you wanted to give up badly and kept going regardless? When was the last time you sat down in the middle of the
        night and wondered, 'Where am I refusing to do what needs to be done'? When was the last time you looked at
        yourself in the mirror and thought to yourself: 'I'm a useless coward, let's fix that'? - There were times when
        I could answer with pride; knowing that I gave my best. How I got to these times you may ask? Simple, I admitted
        that I was a girl a bit more than three years ago and started to fix my life slowly. It took two years of
        self-improvement until I started with the gym. A month later I was able to break free from my last bad habit,
        social media consumption. Two weeks later I got rid of every trauma. Another two weeks later I started to get up
        at five every day and spent three hours outside next to the one hour of gym. Your journey gets faster the longer
        you spend on it. The two years of self-improvement where nothing seemed to happen weren't wasted, I built
        momentum without any externally visible results. I didn't just start sacrificing music and getting up at half
        past three as a 13-year-old. I gradually worked myself up to my current level. I started at the bottom. </p>

    <p><em><strong>In enough pain, you can 'just decide' and the problem is fixed.</strong></em> But then, there were
        also times when I didn't gradually improve but drastically. In pain after a rejection, I decided to sacrifice
        music and I kept my word for three months while thirty days were planned. There is nothing else to write about
        it. If you are in deep despair, you can change pretty much anything instantly. If you don't have enough pain,
        you won't be able to recreate this 'just deciding'. I wanted to sacrifice music from the three months of
        December, January, and February 2024, and I wasn't able to since I wasn't suffering sufficiently. I was also
        able just to decide to shower cold more than a year ago and kept my word. </p>

    <p><em><strong>The middle ground.</strong></em> The fusion of the first and second paths is an example as well.
        Over a year ago, in December 2022, I calculated the time spent on my phone watching random nonsense or playing
        games, I estimated around seven thousand hours, which is a year. Pain! For two weeks I didn't even dare to touch
        my phone. Unfortunately, digital addiction is too powerful to 'decide to get rid of it'. Shaming me into not
        touching my phone for two weeks reset my baseline and made me confident for further progress. It also made
        slipping back more shameful, as I knew I was able to resist. The slip back was a part of the progress and I
        continued out more or less slowly for four months until I was done once and for all by April 2023. Starting
        radically, slipping back, cutting out slowly, and then defeating the problem once and for all works well in
        certain
        situations. </p>

    <p><em><strong>The second path is to restore self-respect. </strong></em> However, I haven't fully described the
        second path, the one of just deciding and summoning the event where you change and 'just decide'. When you lose
        your self-respect by promising yourself to write that diary or not to procrastinate, you should use the event.
        First of all, take a piece of paper make a written promise to God, and hang it on your wall. Take out your diary
        and start with the words “I messed up …”. You will need to think through your weakness and find a reason as to
        why you messed up and how you can avoid it. Do this as an actionable step, then come back to reading, or how
        often do you want to keep the weakness inside of you? Be brutally honest with yourself. Next, clean your room
        and have an intense workout with a cold shower. That's catharsis to restore your self-respect. </p>

    <p><em><strong>You can't rush your weak phase.</strong></em> My weak phase, the one that started in September, six
        months ago after the loss of my purpose, I tried multiple times to regain my discipline. And I sort of was able
        to, but not to the level of my best days. But still, I deluded myself into thinking that I was able to restore
        hardcore discipline as I have used the second path many times. Only now my weakness seems to fade and I regain
        strength, so do not try to rush. The turning point was something like three weeks ago when I started to regain
        strength slowly. I'm confident, in a month I will be strong enough to use the second path again. However, now
        that I know I'm returning to strength, I know that I have no excuses.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Also, stop obsessing over yourself and do sports instead.</strong></em> When you lose a purpose, you
        become a hedonist because there is nothing above you. Thinking about yourself too much causes you to suffer and
        makes you enter a low phase. What you have to understand, is that sports are the way out of low phases. It
        helped me a lot to start running 10 km every day to return to strength. Not lying in bed with too much free time
        and wondering how to entertain yourself. If you train hard, practically every other problem evaporates.</p>

    <p><em><strong>In the end, do not worry.</strong></em> A person who has seen everything becomes a son of God. That's
        part of your journey. Do not try to rush things, you can't stop a weak phase. After enough time passes, be
        ready. Hence, restore your discipline and move uphill with small steps. On the path uphill, it doesn't matter
        how shamefully small the first steps are. Alternatively, if you are in enough pain, and need to clean your soul,
        reflect deeply and you should be able to keep your promise. </p>
