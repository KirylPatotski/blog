  <h1><span style="color: #FFC400;">Colors</span> of <span style="color: #FFC400;">Helimath</span>: Shaping User
    Experience Through Thoughtful Design</h1>
  <p>As you may have noticed, my app Helimath has a very significant impact on how you experience the app.</p>

  <h2>Why I chose <span style="color: #FFC400;">yellow</span></h2>
  <p>Originally, I wanted to make the app <span style="color: purple;">purple</span> or <span
      style="color: #00008B;">dark blue</span> to create a more relaxing environment. For a few months, Helimath
    featured this color scheme. However, I felt the need to experiment with different colors and their effects.</p>
  <p>I decided to explore the color <span style="color: orange;">orange</span>, but it proved to be challenging to find
    the perfect shade that didn't look too red or too yellow. Luckily, Android Studio, the software used to develop
    Android apps, offered a variety of prebuilt color palettes.</p>
  <p>While I didn't initially like the prebuilt color palettes due to their minimalist and weak colors, Android Studio
    had a color palette that included a hue similar to the regionizable <span style="color: #FFC400;">yellow</span>. I
    took this color and made it slightly darker to create a unique shade for Helimath.</p>

  <h2>The Effects of Colors</h2>
  <p>Colors have a profound impact on our emotions, perceptions, and overall experience. Each color carries its own
    psychological associations and can evoke different feelings:</p>

  <h3><span style="color: #FFC400;">Yellow</span></h3>
  <p><span style="color: #FFC400;">Yellow</span> is often associated with positivity, enthusiasm, and joy. It can
    stimulate mental activity, creativity, and optimism. By incorporating a vibrant shade of <span
      style="color: #FFC400;">yellow</span> into Helimath, the aim was to create an atmosphere that encourages user
    engagement, motivates exploration, and fosters a positive mindset.</p>

  <h3>Red in <span style="color: red;">GymMath</span></h3>
  <p>In contrast to the <span style="color: #FFC400;">yellow</span> used in Helimath, the app <span
      style="color: red;">GymMath</span> utilizes the color <span style="color: red;">red</span>. <span
      style="color: red;">Red</span> is commonly associated with energy, passion, and intensity. By infusing <span
      style="color: red;">GymMath</span> with <span style="color: red;">red</span>, the intention was to create an
    atmosphere that aligns with the determination and focus required for physical exercise.</p>

  <h2>The Effects of Colors on Branding</h2>
  <p>Color choices are also crucial in branding. Brands carefully select colors that represent their values,
    personality, and target audience:</p>

  <p>By carefully selecting colors that align with the brand's values, personality, and target audience, businesses can
    create a memorable and impactful visual identity. Colors can shape the overall user experience, evoke specific
    emotions, and establish a strong brand presence that resonates with users.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the color choices made for Helimath and GymMath were driven by a deep understanding of the
    psychological effects of colors. The deliberate selection of <span style="color: #FFC400;">yellow</span> in Helimath
    aimed to evoke positivity, enthusiasm, and intellectual stimulation, fostering an engaging user experience.
    Similarly, the use of <span style="color: red;">red</span> in GymMath aimed to stimulate energy, passion, and
    determination, aligning with the mindset required for physical exercise.</p>
  <p>Color choices are not limited to app design alone; they play a crucial role in branding as well. The strategic use
    of colors can enhance brand recognition, convey a specific message, and leave a lasting impression on the target
    audience. With the evolving landscape of modern branding, businesses must carefully consider their color choices to
    ensure alignment with their brand identity and desired user experience. By understanding the psychology behind
