    <h1>The power of reflection</h1>

    <p>If there was a magic wand to turn a failure, mistake, or setback into a victory, how frequent would its usage be?
        If this tool could also prevent failures by adjusting course or prevent mistakes from escalating, how frequently
        would you use it then? If I told you that this tool is very cheap - it costs little time and no money - how
        often would you use this tool then? Let me reveal what this tool is. It's called pause and reflection. Of
        course, there is nothing completely free in this world, you pay with humility, with your ego. This tool, it's
        romantic. You sit down with a piece of paper and a pen, under the light of a candle, and think about your
        decisions. You take inspiration from powerful questions and start with conscious-with-hands-crossed-sitting, and
        each time you know that your life will change and set sails towards a brighter sky. All while helping you to
        achieve stillness of the mind. While reflecting, you think without expectations and cease to express desires.
        Ever desireless, you start to see the truth. Ever desiring you drift off-course and need to adjust, there is no
        action without assessment. There is no lesson without pain unless you reflect with infinite humility. Hence,
        reflection is the highest form of meditation. </p>

    <p><em><strong>1. What's the biggest thing holding me back?</strong></em></p>

    <p>Many answers might follow, as this question often provides a much more accurate reflection of who you are in
        comparison to what you claim to be doing. This question, just like the rest provides a very romantic view of
        life, every time you ask this question, your life betters in an instant, you let go and feel lighter, due to the
        certainty that the decision added and the weight you let go of.</p>

    <p>Most people will never ask this question or delude themselves into thinking that nothing is holding them back.
        So, let me guess what's holding you back: it's internet usage, an excess of instant gratification, a lack of
        sleep, loser friends, and a shortage of meditation. Once you fix each of these things, there will be always new
        things appearing, and every time letting go will bring fulfillment. For example, in October 2023 I let go of the
        app I 'learned' Chinese on since spring 2021 after hesitating for a long time and wasting time while hesitating.
        Since I got rid of every bigger obstacle such as internet usage, I'm not far from perfect, every further change
        is simple to implement. </p>

    <p><em>I wanted to write that nothing was holding me back, that I could change today, yet then I remembered what
            humility was.</em></p>

    <p>I was held back by a lack of healthy calories, so I went to the store and bought as much food as I could carry
        because my family wouldn't buy enough healthy food. I'm held back by staying in bed in the morning, despite
        having overcome this habit already a while ago. I'm held back by having to walk the dogs in the morning. </p>

    <p><em><strong>2. Which sacrifice needs to be made?</strong></em></p>

    <p>Sometimes things don't hold you back directly, as they create no damage, yet sometimes sacrifices need to be
        made. A simple example is to sacrifice warm water or music. Sometimes much bigger sacrifices require attention,
        especially as a parent. The longer a sacrifice waits, the harder it's going to be. So better adapt quickly,
        because otherwise, you will have failed to not only sense the change but also to adapt to it.</p>

    <p><em><strong>3. What is my true God?</strong></em></p>

    <p>You need to obsess over the right things and gain control over your subconscious. If your goal is the only thing
        you can think about, it becomes your God, so to speak. If you obsess over traumas, they become your God. Most
        people have their phone as their God - the first thing in the morning is checking the phone and that's also the
        last thing in the evening and they can't live without it. Yet, those are not the real God. This way of life is
        not sustainable and neither is it authentic. You must come closer to the true God instead of false ones, like
        your phone. Additionally, you must accept that things like goals are, for the lack of a better word, good, but
        not ultimate, so you might also need to readjust your priorities. You must also control what you think about. I
        do not encourage laziness. I encourage the remembrance of what your life really is about, and not what currently
        matters most to you. What matters in this instant is perhaps completely irrelevant in the next 5 years.</p>

    <p><em><strong>4. Which conversation am I avoiding?</strong></em></p>

    <p>The conversation you are avoiding can be one of the biggest things holding you back. Yet, after the conversation,
        which usually lasts no more than 5 minutes and is rarely awkward, you will likely have transformed your life.
        For example. My mother and stepfather wanted me to apply to internships for the 4 months after school and before
        the study. After being hesitant for a while with these applications, I noticed that I may have changed too much
        and I am no longer compatible with programming. So, I talked to my parents about it and now I'm free from this
        expectation, i.e. you need to let other people know of your intentions. </p>

    <p>There is another aspect to this question because it could also mean that you ask out your crush.</p>

    <p>Something related to this is something I wanted to do for a while and did because of this text. In the 2023
        reflection, I mentioned that I had a crush on the best friend of the current girl I want, until September.
        Firstly, I didn't know if I should confess that, as I perhaps would not be able to handle it if roles we
        swapped. I have my right to think so, as I only became interested in her after being under the impression that
        she is interested in me (which is inauthentic and has nothing to do with the spiritual way of life). There were
        many other reasons why I never considered her seriously, for one, she was not exactly my type and secondly,
        there was another girl I liked much more. Then I decided to confess to her since Kant would see the truth as a
        moral duty. I made this decision already a while ago and kept waiting, I wanted to confess in February. Then, I
        started to write this text and realized that it would be much better for everyone if I told it now than the last
        time we would see each other, this has the advantage that it wouldn't cause much damage, since it would give
        time to break fantasies by encountering each other in person rather than in the realm of thoughts. I wanted to
        tell her that she must desire to work on herself, sit upright, stop using the internet, and go to the gym, I
        also wanted to tell her, that in university, she would have the chance to present herself as a completely new,
        better version of herself. I also wanted to tell her what I just told you, with Kant, when exactly I had an
        interest in her and that she must not worry about it. Then, a few days ago I only said “We only see each other
        ~10 times for the rest of our lives and I wanted to tell you that I had a crush on you in 11th grade.” The
        reaction was kind of disappointing because she just made a comment on how fast time flies by, blushed and we
        both walked away. By the way, both of us are going to remember this moment for the rest of our lives. Then, I
        went home and started to think ill of myself, because I wanted to have told much more. But now I don't think
        about it anymore, because another friend of hers told me that confessing was right and it did not cause any
        damage. A normal person would have written about nervousness and yes, nervous I was! Now I'm at peace.</p>

    <p><em><strong>5. Is a label holding me back?</strong></em></p>

    <p>Most people try to label themselves constantly and these identities are often quite useful, I advocated for
        better identities in almost every text prior. You must see yourself as a fighter because then trying hard will
        come at ease, you must view yourself as a monk because then you will find excellent discipline… </p>

    <p>What a stupid person would say is “I'm a night person”, “I'm a morning person”, “I'm a person that spends time
        with losers”, “I'm a woman”, “I'm a cat person”, “I'm bad at math” or “I'm a person who dyes their hair.” You
        know, I would like to slap you in the face for saying such things, but lucky for you that would be amoral. E.g.
        “I'm a night person” is complete nonsense, if you need to wake up early, you wake up early, if you need to stay
        up late, you stay up late. It's a simple as that. I've never said to be a morning person, not even in the 4 am
        guide, rather, I've said that there is no such thing as a morning or evening person. “I'm bad at math” is
        complete nonsense as well. I'm bad at German class (I go to school in Germany, so that's where we write texts
        and so on), yet I doubtlessly write better than anyone in my school. If you are bad at something, just get
        better and stop coping with your identity, because your identity is merely a facade.</p>

    <p>Identities must be positive, for example, “I'm a person who plays hard.” If it's too hard to execute, give
        yourself another “I'm a person that is almost consistent with the virtue of giving everything.”</p>

    <p>Identities start with languages. “I'm going to try out this relationship” is significantly more problematic than
        “I'm likely never going to be single again.” “I will try out running” is the weaker version of “I'm going to
        become an athlete.” You must cut out alternatives to a large extent, that's what deciding means. </p>


    <p><em><strong>6. Where does this come from and does it serve me?</strong></em></p>

    <p>We already learned that some identities are unproductive, and so are many beliefs. Most people learn to become
        human by listening to others and then never learn to become themselves. They believe in thinking “realistically”
        while never educating themselves on that subject in the first place. I wanted to get a bit aggressive and point
        to some examples but then I noticed that almost everything that the average person believes is wrong. “You can't
        just get rid of a depression” is what most people are sunk in and it may be true scientifically, but what about
        the people that broke free, without help from anyone? “Traumas will haunt you for the rest of your life unless
        you talk about them” Guess what? I never talked with anyone about my traumas, not even in my blog after months
        when I had already overcome them and still let go of them all. Some nerd would respond, "Well, you can't look at
        yourself and conclude onto others” and I could try to argue against that argument, but who am I helping? I
        indoctrinated myself that it's possible and it worked. I don't think that a person who says that you can't
        decide to simply stop being depressed does not have your best interest at heart is just a bit stupid. Their
        beliefs do not serve you. </p>

    <p>Your parents' beliefs will often contradict yours. Your parents want to be proud of you, but to become successful
        you have to fail a lot. Even the beliefs of the people closest to you will have points in which they misalign.
    </p>

    <p>A bit sharper is the consideration of value from people who don't even know you. Most content does not,
        especially if it propagates instant gratification. Often information from external sources tries to sell you
        something and sometimes it just gives out, for your situation, wrong advice. For example, I'm trying to sell my
        future books and my advice is wrong if you want to be a peasant. </p>

    <p>Likewise, assess whether the things you want stem from your authentic desire or whether they have been
        indoctrinated into you. At this point I find material desires to be unworthy of mentioning. One of the most
        common harmless fake desires is travel. If we look at the rather harmful ones then it's the desire to never
        settle with a romantic partner. I must admit, that despite gaining control over my mind, I still couldn't fully
        delete this belief that does not serve me. You see, you assess opinions, beliefs, and desires by looking at
        where they come from, and where they go. Speak it aloud to make it sound clearer, it's better to look like an
        idiot for doing so than it is to have a life of regret. </p>

    <p>Why do you fear something, why do you desire it, why do you believe it to be true? If you are uncertain, deprive
        yourself of everything to figure out the truth. </p>

    <p><em><strong>7. How can I mess this up?</strong></em></p>

    <p>My road to riches and success is in decently low resolution. Hence, I don't know what to do with razor-sharp
        precision. What I do know are the yields to the questions <strong><em>“What does the least successful
                version of me look like?”</em></strong> and <strong><em>“Where did I not learn my lesson?”</em></strong>
        So, by not
        doing certain things it's decently easy to establish the certainty of success. The least
        successful version of mine has bad habits, is a pushover, awkward … That means the most successful version of
        mine is disciplined, assertive, charismatic…</p>

    <p><em><strong>What does this word mean?</strong></em> Now it may not be entirely clear what 'charismatic' even
        means. The dictionary definition is completely useless: “Exercising a compelling charm which inspires devotion
        in others.” No, that's too complicated. Charisma, means, having a firm handshake, sitting upright, being well
        dressed and groomed, holding eye contact, mindfulness, warmth, power… You see, now it's a lot simpler. Can you
        have a firm handshake? If not, do some pushups. If you have no clue what to do or think of what to not do, the
        brain always looks for problems and not for solutions. Then, think of what the words you wrote down mean.</p>

    <p>I have little idea of how to make a relationship work. How can it fail on my behalf? Neglect, becoming a loser,
        boredom, annoyance, unclear communication, temptations/unfaithfulness, conflicts with family her family, lack of
        respect, getting fat, comparison, lack of trust, and non-acceptance. Most of them are not going to happen,
        because usually there is only one chain link that breaks. For me, it's not getting fat or communicating unclear,
        but rather the desire to change, i.e. non-acceptance. But now we are drifting too far away, what does neglect
        mean for example? Neglect means being only focused on yourself, cutting yourself off from everything, not giving
        little gifts, not making compliments… Hence, to avoid this problem, I must do these things and not do the
        opposite. The #1 reason why relationships fail, from an oversimplified but not less accurate perspective of a
        16-year-old, is because the couple takes each other for granted and the man becomes a loser. How do you not
        become a loser? You do pushups, breathe deeply, sit upright, and look at the sun for 2 hours straight, and 95%
        of your problems are gone. Anyone who has any problems doesn't understand how simple their solutions often are
        because they have never taken a pencil in their hand to reflect. What does reflection mean? You take a pencil,
        and a checkered piece of paper, clean your room, and write down what you think. Simple, right? </p>

    <p><em>“The world is simple and we insist on making it complicated” - Confucius</em></p>


    <p><em><strong>8.	Knowing what I know now, would I still do it?</strong></em></p>

    <p>This is a demonstration whether you are able to learn.</p>

    <p><em><strong>9. Am I eating blueberries and prioritizing sand?</strong></em></p>

    <p>Every person, without any exception who claims to have 'problems,' likes to eat sand. The sand is not as
        metaphoric as you might expect. When you fill a jar, with apples, with raisins, and then with rice, you can fit
        all of them, but if you start with the rice, there will be no space left for the apples, for that which is truly
        important. Every moment matters and your life consists of countless micro-moments lined up. How can you afford
        to waste them on simple things? I want to give an example which surely didn't happen to me. My mother asked me
        to carry a flower from one room to another and then a day later I was supposed to put it back. That's a goldfish
        level of existence, you have to focus on meaning and then fill the little remaining time with doing chores
        rather than reverting this order. Focusing on the blueberries won't remove your hunger, just as eating sand,
        symbolizing the priority of simple tasks over meaningful ones. I spent zero hours a year changing my YouTube
        profile picture, instead I created videos. Maybe your everyday life is too stressful because you are a
        collection of bad habits, desperately trying to resolve outer and inner conflicts, and by wasting your little
        time outside of the indulgence of pleasure doing useless things, sunk in your pragmatism. “Oh, my profile
        picture, it needs to look pretty.” </p>

    <p><em><strong>“Where am I interfering too much?”</em></strong> Most problems resolve themselves and most worries
        never happen. Focusing on the sand won't bring you anywhere. <em><strong>“Why can't I meditate for 15 minutes a
                day?”</em></strong> Is a quite similar question. If your day consists of mindlessness, surely, you will
        find time for nothing. The average screen time is 4 hours a day. I can write 3000 words in that time. What did
        you gain by spending 4 hours on social media? <em><strong>“Well, I can't delete social media, my friends are on
                it”</em></strong> What the hell, how can be talking about friends if you are unable to gain control of
        15 minutes a day? <em><strong>“How often did I sit upright today?”</em></strong></p>

    
    <p><em>Now we are getting a bit more romantic again.</em></p>

    <p><em><strong>10. Is this how I want to live?</strong></em></p>

    <p>My ideal life includes many things and excludes even more. Yet, hoping for things to change on their own never
        comes true. Hoping for more time to get released never comes true. After school comes university, after
        university comes work, after work comes family, after family comes the last days of work, then retirement, and
        then death. There will be many moments where you will notice sailing too far off course, and this question will
        set you back on course. </p>

    <p><em><strong>11. Do I lean beyond my true edge?</strong></em></p>

    <p>I used to solve 45 mental math tasks a day on my own app, which is now an abandoned project. Then, I decided to
        solve 10,000 of them and it only took 11 hours. You must lean beyond your true edge every day. Train hard, work
        hard, and live life in a state of competition.</p>

    <p><em><strong>12. What can I do to avoid regret? </strong></em></p>

    <p>Well, …</p>
